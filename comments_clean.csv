trimming nail will help lot especially back the cat will work get sharp point the front one but those aren the one that usually hurt the most accident sometimes cat will jump too hard and give you dig with the back one but isn too bad unless the cat scared something just walking you might give you poke but not wound more le like your nail might overexcited playing might lead scratching with the front especially young cat they can sometimes forget you don have fur all over best advice try and learn cat body language and mannerism reading and observation will make you more confident when you interact with the cat which will also make the cat le nervous about you ,1
you might want help the old guy with the back claw they get older harder strip the claw and they get too long they can affect the gait and cause pain sometimes you just need pull the old claw off the new one hand ,1

extreme case you might just have let your new cat just have room her own rescued cat who had been abused kid and then abandoned open rescue with lot other cat she wa hostile everything and just wanted place her own she would hiss the door she even imagined cat might out there the year since she ha calmed down lot people and little more the other cat but one other female considers her psycho with reason and try drive her off despite being just over half her size but the cat fine with her own thing her own room and love having visit now general female tend far more sensitive alien cat the area since they expect need raise kitten any moment another female integrated started out chasing the other male cat out her area until wa half the house then she relaxed and accepted them safe and there wa more issue your shoe would slow the tempo and let her become more comfortable her space the bedroom another area that can hers and then slowly bring the kitten into her space vice versa ,1
doing this would have caused much unnecessary stress for this cat and wa pointless wa this cat owner furious ,1

could her personality but could also she’ looking for her friend from wherever she wa before second cat may help her but may not that one gamble whatever the root cause you need behavior training with basic behavior training you can either add stimulus encourage good behavior add stimulus discourage bad behavior remove stimulus discourage bad behavior remove stimulus encourage good behavior sound complicated and not basic sorry ’ still basic and probably make more sense when you put them all context ’ try with two when you remove stimulus ignoring her discourage her bad behavior screaming her fool head off have one feel your pain the bad behavior will get worse before get better because they amp their effort before they give when she got worse when you ignored her wa normal try again dig your heel with ’ going take few day worse behavior before start get better screaming cat get mood where that’ all she doe and she’ been fixed ’ not issue her being heat but she’ learned few thing she really only yell like that when are trying sleep bedroom door open she might get attention even ’ yelling her stop yelling sometimes work but all the door are closed and she can’ see human give her attention even bad attention attention she will stop few minute not immediately after the door closed cat have four are not allowed bedroom when are sleeping because sleep with the door closed because noisy kitty who doe not get along with two the others she closed room the yelling louder until someone pet her pick her and deposit her outside the bedroom then she promptly shuts all the door are closed she only yell periodically during the day now but when she doe ’ only for minute ignoring her before she quits sometimes she’ quiet she get treat catnip her yelling mostly night may help teach her the way taught mine you are able sleep with her outside the closed bedroom door ,1

you feed your cat fish regular basis ,1
lost bunch weight over couple year used pretty chunky when wa really young just concerned because can feel feel much skinnier than the other one especially around the back bone and the pelvis ,1
think that what the comment implied ,1
omg the neck floof ,1
just when cook would let him have piece feed them really good food with high meet content though ,1
maybe different color collar tell them apart cuties and two are much more fun than one ,1
whatever you make sure doe not stick his tongue light pole you end like the kid from christmas story ,1
and the catnip ,1
would bring him into the vet until then try monitoring his food intake closely for few day give him wet food kibble something that you know like and keep track how much eats the fact that won eat large cut meat isn concerning had picky cat that have interest meat they just want kibble weight loss and decreased overall eating that are cause for concern ,1

friend mine her cat wa diabetic and with proper care she lived until she wa like believe she had give her daily shot but wa very manageable hope you kitty and you can find treatment that work for you both ,1
have one named seymour would have named him kevin but already named kid that and would just too confusing ,1
wish had pencil thin mustache then could solve some mystery too ,1
will watch food intake thanks just one last thing give them good food with high meat content and every now and then give them the normal food you get your local supermarket they love the stuff because all the aroma that are them can happen that they stop eating the good food because they want the artificial flavor ,1
did just ,1
same with cat except they both want held the same time ,1
she wa asleep the first time but now pain get ,1
she mold every spot she sits ,1
could some kind cat food are more junky than others the same way that doritos are junky and then taste better because that ,1

yes cat became diabetic due being steroid ’ really manageable don’ stress gave her shot the morning while she wa eating and then another one night while giving her treat she never really noticed the hardest part wa timing schedule revolved bit around her’ but all that will depend how much insulin you have give daily basis cat wasn’ getting lot insulin and never had check her glucose level but know owner who have had and ’ just pricking the ear with glucose monitor one for human fine double check with your vet though you may want make two person job for checking ’ sugar level you have you may have change the diet that will struggle your cat picky patient two caveat you don’ have pet insurance that cover the medication insulin can very expensive like 300 ’ the ’ also frustrating you don’ have give lot and you don’ through before expires ’ important ask you vet how long good once opened there risk hypoglycemia her sugar level drop too low keep caro syrup hand that you can give her and then take her the vet ’ sure your vet will tell you what look for but you forget there are many many website that will show the symptom with picture even don’ let having inject the insulin scare you will become second nature real quick feel free message you have any other question wa super afraid when cat became diabetic but controllable and not huge deal ,1

maintaining his weight and good health otherwise may just that switched his preferred eating style grazing sometimes cat graze simply because they bored and like the attention being fed quick vet visit always wise idea just rule out any health issue always easier and cheaper treat anything they might find earlier rather than after becomes bigger issue guess peeing and pooping normally nothing else seems off ,1

start with two open box you can experiment with closed one after they are acclimated you will want make thing easy they adjust the big move would remain with similar dry food then try wet snack like most cat they love wet then the transition easy but some cat just never really like wet food need force them fountain are very good idea kidney issue are common with cat they come from desert animal and overwork their kidney save water most stratchers aren tall enough for large cat have the wrong material some cat prefer cardboard horizontal one others vertical the best vertical one the ultimate scratcher pioneer pet the cat are smaller they just use the bottom part kitten and energetic cat climb the top you can get cheap cardboard horizontal lounge and see the cat like before getting final one you want tower for climbing just get one for that many tower don have good material for scratcher they are too short even elderly cat like tower they can get stage putting near stairway even let them straight the top through the bannister get advantage topical stuff from vet pretty easy use but one mine reacts the smell and drool like fountain toy can eased into you can make fun thing with scrap cardboard paper wad and shoestring until you find what the cat for used baby brush with wide spaced plastic bristle each with ball the end for grooming persian ,1

can confirm the ear cut adopted big orange feral cat shelter when walked over and selected laying down lap hit you not this what wa his adoption record read told volunteer said max ha been returned several time and each time people returned him they would put another small cut his ear wa also feral and adoptable that would not fit into people home due excessive scratching clawing and out litter box use they began get this driving him drop off point further and further from the facility their acreage hoping stay feral cat but kept finding his way back yeah now just here trying get out all the time and nobody want him because nasty god while heart wa breaking into million piece brain flashing picture about this poor cat life the first thing thing wa able utter very quietly and through clenched teeth wa well shit didn fit people home sherlock wa feral cat want outside you guy tell these adopter they must keep the cat indoor they fined will never indoor cat open the door when want out then open again when want this isn rocket science here exactly like having dog had idea the owner the facility had walked into the doorway behind and heard everything said she walked over introduced herself shook hand and told those were all good point that she didn realize how bad wa until read out loud and that something had change regarding the policy indoor only because clearly that wasn working that much they want them reality some cat and dog will just never ever happy the house all the time fairly short time they moved from their location animal can certainly longer dropped off their acreage and policy did fact change there more cutting the ear they tattoo tiny mark and they also spend good deal time evaluating the animal now determine they should indoor only indoor outdoor personally knowing what max went through wa very happy see all these improvement ,1

give him time what would probably only have low light like lamp not bright overhead light and then would lay tummy next the bed and just talk him soothing tone and let him inch you don longer than say twenty minute unless that time frame move close enough pet don crowd him but try and make him more comfortable with you going come out eventually just give that sweet boy some time treat help ,1

our full grown cat eats cup day and that the required amount kitten definitely need le than cup ,1
okae bad don’ that ,1
that’ fantastic design ,1
wa forced put food water and litter room bathroom quite some time ago really didn have choice the matter once realized the reason she wasn using the others have two other littlerboxes and catgenie elsewhere wa somewhat hopeful when the largest the fold started sitting doorway now and then guard the only one that actually play with garfield the crazy attacker his sister the thing she ha actually attacked leg when stuck between the two them but one the other cat get the way she will stop and turn around sometimes fully retreating the other side the house sometimes wish she would force garfield into response have doubt the larger mix breed street cat would win actual showdown and probably end the entire problem just doesn seem like going happen ,1
say depends the cat lifestyle have incredibly active indoor outdoor cat and they each easily through more than cup day each them are ideal weight well should pay attention his cat weight and whether not seeing change it attitude lifestyle ,1
what darling guy ,1
omg this wa read out context tho ‍♀️ lol really tho ,1

for kitten under month you can let them “free feed” and have open access food all day opposed feeding distinct meal because their stomach are much smaller than full grown cat would start feeding the recommended serving amount listed the food bag the morning and see how long take her finish next time you visit your veterinarian for vaccination check see their recommendation based your kitten age and weight ,1

’ surprising how easily they form bond with new cat dog you get another cat take slow keep them separate room start they’ able smell each other and start getting used another pet the house after day let them have bit contact there will hissing and maybe even some swatting but unless really escalates just let them figure out you could also try long string under the door when they’ different room and seem they’ play together although that might take some time patient you stick with just the one cat the extra playing and attention should help with the late night demand ,1

wish only had two cat lol ’ with cat rescue ’ got couple foster adopt out cat well rescuing fixing them and see tension between the residing and new kitty frequently you really want another one have some suggestion sometimes getting kitten instead adult cat can make the previous cat feel le intimidated always tell adopter keep the new kitty ’ own room for minimum week help them not overwhelmed with their new surroundings but also allows the cat smell each other under the door and get know one another before the introduction generally suggest waiting minimum two week before determining they won’ get along what you could find rescue that need foster explain you’ interested fostering see your kitty could potentially get along with another one then doesn’ work out after two week you can give the kitten back question asked you could try pair sibling then they would play with each other and leave residing kitty alone sorry for the novel good luck ,1

layla got little constipated about month ago but her vet just suggested give her small dose miralax which seemed work getting her poop other than that and her being bit louder than normal there were sign although she wa always suuuuuper hungry and the vet think that’ because the hair tie weren’ allowing her body absorb all the nutrient from her food were obstructing some part that process ’ always worth check you’ worried about some symptom your kitty having though and super great that your conscious about their toy and leaving hair tie around wish could have prevented this but roommate and are also glad that this can learning experience for others ,1

sure love red thing and being upside down ,1
his eye are beautiful cat eye color ha changed three four cat over the year spot anything but perhaps ’ harmless any case keep taking photo his eye and dating them and maybe bring again his next appointment you’ concerned that way the vet can see the change when they occurred and they are worrisome ,1

well especially for female cat help they don keep getting pregnant and having litter baby over and over again which can lead lot complication like hyper swollen uterus and obviously pregnancy and birth carry risk for the mother quite often most importantly though prevent dozen and sometimes hundred kitten from being born feral every year where they often end dying the cold fighting for resource and going hungry being orphaned and overall causing the outdoor cat population balloon very very rapidly which bad for all the cat which lead often shorter more miserable life and are bad for the environment since house cat are invasive specie which are already responsible for the extinction many different type bird plus every kitten season hundred kitten found outside end flooding shelter and using resource and often end being euthanized before they even have chance life trapping neutering and then returning your local feral cat their outdoor home because feral adult cat are feral and always will feral they cannot safely adopted pet after certain age the best and most humane way help control cat population minimize suffering and maximize resource called tnr and your local animal shelter probably ha program that you can volunteer for which what thinking doing but yeah don want make bad mistake and trap the wrong cat thus the purpose this post ,1
when gone make whoever watching own big floof send daily picture not more ,1
then you remember ’ london and crash ,1
read your desired food can bag feeding recommendation ask your parent exactly how much they feed day ask describe bit more give you whatever they use scoop over month start reducing the amount until you get down their desired food you want boil chicken and use that for food topper their dinner help them make overnight without bothering you for starter always advise never free feed and get them schedule treat they are not human food treat should still most treat are 5cal per piece ,1
wtf did you that poor cat you monster look miserable ,1
one coworkers just left and said have great weekend this wa definitely her today she wa done she wa already friday mentally ,1
exactly the same thing remind when saw this picture toroto with umbrella ,1
live trap are bad idea you don get pick the one cat kitten that go and will quite traumatizing them unless you are willing put the time that take get them trust you enough walk into carrier that you can then slam the door shut you will likely not successful their owner this especially true they are now old enough run around this course assumes that the mother also feral she friendly you she can teach her kitten also the other issue with live trap the cat kitten can injure themselves trying get out important that you stay within ear shot and take them out immediately very difficult get feral cat out live trap unless you bring into the space that you expect live and let this isn ideal will need dewormed and defleaed and checked out vet other issue you will likely only get one and will likely mom she will want check out ensure it safe for her kitten kitten aren heavy enough set off the trap that full grown cat fit and won fit the smaller one your best bet gain their trust slowly trap them all with carrier and bring them all the vet next find suitable owner for the one you arent keeping but commit fostering them all until this happens ,1
what lookin ,1
also you should just always spay neuter cat literally always especially they your pet help prevent lot behavioral problem related mating season along with accidental kitten obviously ,1
moooooood ,1
some animal shelter rent out cat trap you might have ask specifically for kitten trap kitten might not heavy enough trigger regular trap ,1
that only for feral cat that have been spayed neutered that trapper tnr program know that they have already been neutered and don need through tnr program again signal they can left alone live out the rest their feral life outside since feral cat after certain age longer adoptable period ,1

honestly the best thing would get your cat eat wet food dry food matter the kind always cling the teeth and produce build just try eating bone dry cookie yourself ’ the same thing plus dry food always bad for your cat kidney they can never drink enough compensate know that ’ hard get cat that used dry food eat wet food but ’ worth the end help keep your cat teeth clean you should give some raw meat for example cat love chicken wing and eats them with the whole bone but some cat could struggle with that ,1

ahh sorry assumed you were the that’ strange your vet said that although very common overlook dental disease what put dab the toothpaste index finger gently hold other hand behind kitty’ head she doesn’ escape and rub all over kitty’ gum and teeth don’ know how comfortable your cat will let you have finger her mouth first you will probably need warm her simply letting her lick the special toothpaste and reward her with dental treat too tried using toothbrush specifically design for small pet human toothbrush are bad and human toothpaste toxic but ’ just too difficult since she think ’ trying gag her something there are these toothbrush cap you can like put around your finger specifically for cat but haven’ tried those yet the line gingivitis that wa quite red ha now gotten very much fainter ,1

not sure about specific option but ha kibble don just aim for grain free because company use grain and such protein and calorie filler which not optimal but better some case than the grain free alternative which often just use potato other starchy alternative instead the main three reason avoid kibble are not enough moisture natural prey minimum moisture kibble about this lead urinary and kidney problem because cat drink lot le water than they need dry too much energy from carbohydrate leading many issue mainly diabetes related and protein from the wrong source leading protein malabsorption and developmental ailment this friend must feed cheap kibble aim for whatever you can that us le isolated plant protein pea protein rice protein etc and le high energy sweet plant food rice potato carrot etc one could argue though that ha have lot starchy plant for one with whole grain some kind since that closest cat natural diet mouse and bird that have been eating wheat rice corn farmer field also recommended add water kibble make kind kibble and gravy thing help raise moisture level also encourage purchase land animal meat and the closer wild bird rodent chicken turkey rabbit etc the better avoid fish many cat have sensitivity are allergic and fish consumption can lead deficiency long term which can cause blindness not mention the toxicity buildup practical term the first three more ingredient should meat some kind plant should start far down the list possible and make sure the food contains some kind organ meat turkey gibblets chicken liver rabbit heart etc basically the closest you can get food that resembles mouse small bird that been eating grain the farm day and day out the better the food will for the cat ,1
can you provide link where can buy your print please ,1
knowing that one the cat the painting share name with cat definitely need get this action ,1

believe for kitten the bottle will say week older make sure specifically say use cat also just make sure not get their face near the eye and wash out real well they will lick themselves dry and just fyi the shampoo will help but ’ not going completely solve the problem over the counter flea collar would stronger treatment after you bathe them and before you can see the vet cat came home infested and just used dawn shampoo had couple time but worked real well kept her inside though and she wa put regular vet prescribed flea medicine ever since ,1
you recall the brand that you use ,1

context last couple week had noticed that very dear companion jphh1zwssh 124b7d7f wa sometimes acting little oddly until couple day ago when walking she tripped out nowhere that’ when new for sure that there wa something but wa left guessing for the most part then yesterday wa taking nap and she jumped chest the usual and literally turned her paw for see and layed down like this when emerging from slumber realised that this wa happening took her little paw hand check and she immediately started purring her heart out she usually won’ even let get close her paw she wa showing this wa quite remarquable happening itself found this kind extra claw thing but it straight and protrudes awkwardly out the back her little bean dont know ha anything with that but she also seems unable retract the proper claw that’ opposing but the straight bit obviously seems the source the discomfort and tripping she stepped and kind ofnstung herself just looking for insight the vet wa closed today when swooped wondering ’ just have cut ’ looking into surgery thing which hope not sure hope the best for kitty though she’ whole life and ha been for beautiful year already ,1
she great hope she make you happy ,1
ornery guy had sedated every single vet visit otherwise they couldn’ anything with him would have preferred able sedate him myself but they did there instead ,1

you should get high quality wet food without grain and sugar idea what get the netherlands but here germany good brand are grau mac animonda carny catz finefood mjamjam wet food with sauce most likely not that high quality unfortunately don’ have any english resource though but ’ sure there are cat lover from the netherlands that can help you out better ,1
thank you will ,1
pretty nebbie ,1
mmmmm hhhmmm yeah got opinion about ,1
obligate carnivore have use for rice google what the term mean they just live longer our care see effect aging ,1
tuxedo cat are favorite ,1
cat always the same thing when stroke him ,1
but silently going keep himself and passive aggressively let know ,1
beautiful ,1
right thanks for the answer some dry food ha mixed brown rice assumed ’ okay eat but guess you are right about the ageing part just have accept guess will outlive them ,1
would first get the kitten tested for fiv and feline leukemia before bringing your house after that done have the new kitty live separate room with the door closed for few week and swap out blanket that they sleep that way the cat can get used each others smell after that usually little supervised visitation out side that room with the cat take while but cat generally like the company other cat after they get used each other that the only exception this rule found with calico cat have calico and she wa with the cat that already lived our house when brought her home but those guy have since passed away and she hate the newer cat that gotten since and also like say it awesome that you are going take stray kitty ,1
good you for finding brand with higher meat percentage rice long fully cooked won any harm your cat but since isn part their natural diet doesn much nutritionally and can seen used filler dry food however can helpful your cat having upset stomach diarrhea would recommend prioritizing wet food over dry food cat captivity pet are often terrible staying hydrated case point inject pedialyte into the meat feed our tiger and others normally they receive hydration from blood meat that donated ha blood same issue with dry cat food would also recommend speaking with your vet about what best for your cat since each one may have own special dietary need though hope this give you starting point ,1
think they will they both have wonderful affectionate temperament ,1
going start eye rolling sighing clearing his throat for added judgyness ,1
always ,1
yes him nothing ,1
decadence ,1
will ,1
would also love print very well done two favorite thing right here ,1

jealous mine use con into playing with them ,1
adorable before people say chimera this not chimera ,1
look into that ,1
well dry food ha lot filler quite few canned good too actually just gotta your research the food advice for optimal kidney health feed them much wet you can possible sneak some warm water their canned food and they get into middle age territory try feed low phosphorus food around dry matter basis you can also give each cat 300 combined epa and dha fish oil per day help reduce inflammation the kidney ,1
don’ think she’ that bad bought his kidney feel like the rest the cat belongs ’ miss his hooman scritch post ,1
where can buy ,1
’ found out your right thanks for the help ,1
thank you that wa very kind and thoughtful message have three kitty and they are baby ❤️ give them very little dry food one them already got quite blocked and reduced dry food all them about cup per day they are 2x3 5kg and 1x5kg and about 180gx2 200gx1 wet food every day divided two portion cat don’ drink very much water which annoying can’ really forced them too but just leave water out all the time ’ interesting you keep tiger that sound well fun ,1
too ,1
thanks that’ good idea about adding bit water they can get hydrated while eating and the fish oil ’ sure they’ love and forget about rice ,1
cat ,1
for those interested the left loesje about month old the right luna about month old ,1
dear will never understand the correlation that spaying mutilation have idea where the world you live but here the united state over 2300 kitten are euthanized every single day because there simply isn’ enough home why also continue put your cat through labor delivery well raising her kitten this totally selfish and way worse than spay surgery ,1
this cosmo second cat ever adopted him about month after adopting our first cat love them both but this guy dude get the feeling that might love back unlike our first cat who borderline indifferent towards lol anyway just wanted share enjoy handsome boy ,1
best luck her ,1

that sound like good plan for social cat but the problem with this she tends sleep hiding the couch beside our bed tried make her bed box blanket but she generally ignores she ha always been shy cat since when found her kitten and not very social except for some petting and food maybe feed them together for few week before visitation even the visitation thing might sketchy because she her own cat and doesn like play anything she just like cuddle and separate the rest the time doing cat stuff ,1

domestic cat are obligate carnivore too the amount plant matter most cat food pretty depressing but yes agree that the scottish wildcat need some help and deserves watched the doc netflix when wa added myself ideally all the wildcat would helped though can begrude people from worrying more about cat like tiger the amur leopard it role part scottish heritage good point too the subhect crossbreeding wonder about their domestication potential since crossbreeding such issue the first place wonder hybrid kitten people home least their newsfeeds might get people interested sure more people care about the serval and the asian leopard cat account bengal and savannah than otherwise would kind roundabout way thinking about probably impossible pull off without diverting resource though ,1

won’ help immediately but for later session advice getting them used you touching their paw wait til they are asleep and gently squeeze each paw give special treat afterwards something they really like and only give them for this specifically get them used you gently squeezing out their claw and eventually you should able least clip couple nail each session always reward with the special treat afterwards have former feral kitty that managed tame year old doing this often possible can trim all her nail one session problem now have four cat and all but one them are easy peasy trim one kinda mean can usually only two three claw before she get mad still better than nothing having wrap upset and struggling cat ,1
she look like she’ living the dream ,1
what this breed scottish fold ,1
wa groomed ,1
hope kitty live ,1
negative doesn expire till 2020 and how she work pet store wa prompt for price for some reason and that became ,1

put the valuable one the top securing with wire like the other commenter said good idea too personally just gave and hang actual cat toy tree where they can reach and let them have but just putting cheap plastic ornament you aren’ particularly invested there should work fine too all else fails spray bottle water work deterrent you catch them the act ,1

stop hitting the cat all teach him fear you cat don’ understand punishment and don’ associate with behavior they just associate with you possible you could get 2nd cat her cat probably bored which why ’ being naughty with proper introduction they would play with each other instead bugging you this plan could not work but lot people say are better than get cat tree place for him climb cat like high and have place climb look for double sided tape deterrent spray use them the couch and other furniture and spray his current post with catnip spray attractant this should help with the scratching for fixing your relationship with him you want feed him give him treat play with him let him only associate good thing with you check out jackson galaxy ’ got lot great tip and trick help with naughty cat ,1

you are worrying too much cat pretty much what they please maybe later down the road will want come back that something done lately finding displeasing like that ghost the upper corner ,1
cat like eat just like some them are overly fond eating ’ ask your vet ass your cats’ weight they’ not underweight then you’ not starving them there may low cal snack that would pacify them however ,1

oddlyterrifying ,1
not always true exercise cat plenty and while the outer sheath come off the main nail normally stay intact that said take two minute each cat and just use human toenail clipper you get them used kitten they really don care especially since they know they get treat afterward ,1
doe still other thing used enjoy doe come get pet move and play easily eat and poop ’ probably just cat thing not may some discomfort ,1
’ had him since wa tiny and just kind always handled him lot couldn’ care le what have him trim once the summer with electric clipper and just laid there and purred haha ,1
more actually the front and the back ,1
oddlyterrifying creepy ,1
you need clip them claw you don’ want furniture confetti ,1
the stripe rawr ,1

great now terrified cat ,1
omg not claw literally cutting off the tip their digit feel weird and painful for the rest their life removing essential part their identify and being keep the claw trimmed regular basis and scratching minimal problem your object furniture whatever are more important than that not bring cat into that home but you are both equally horrified after learning what clawing actually may you have many glorious year with your future new family member ,1
agree guess ’ just looking for opinion maybe change his mind ,1
painful for the cat since you are literally cutting their finger tip off and sometimes can leave lasting effect there are many cat who still experience pain even year after the surgery had long healed many year ago had cat declawed and from experience awful idea before being declawed cat would often sleep lap while played with his toe after being declawed wouldn even let touch his paw mother also had her cat declawed the poor cat had arthritis her paw for the rest her life which made walking difficult ,1
work veterinary assistant and ’ seen firsthand the effect these surgery never did the procedure any cat growing don’ want declaw any future kitty but think just uneducated the matter and stubborn just wanted few opinion ,1
specktor ,1
this happened one our cat noticed spot blood the floor and then day two later saw her favoring one paw when she walked turned out her thumb claw had grown into the pad ,1
reminds cream puff ,1
thank you for sharing your story didn’ know could have lasting effect will share this info with ,1
yes our precious may cuddly and cute but beware they are really merciless sadistic predator with the weapon prove ,1
declawing kitten wouldn’ cause any le pain than would adult cat anything would cause the kitten more pain because kitten are high energy and want run around and play there are plenty option deter and prevent scratching that don’ involve causing the cat permanent pain there are spray and training technique additionally you’ cat ever got out ’ assuming you two are planning keep inside considering want declaw currently would have absolutely way defend itself threat came about wouldn’ able fight back easily and climbing escape would also very difficult not impossible ,1
this like wholesome version popping ,1
maximum bean ,1
noted thank you for your response ,1
the mouth ,1
declawing can also cause cat permanent joint pain behavioral issue and problem using litter box can also make them more prone biting which more dangerous than scratch have four cat including previously feral cat and ’ trained all them not play with using their claw keep all their claw trimmed with clipper and have zero issue with them scratching anything other than their scratching post lot people don’ realize cat require some training you want them compatible with living inside with you removing their claw lazy way “fix” issue and often brings worse issue with declawing incredibly cruel and you feel you absolutely have get declawed cat find one that already ha the procedure and give good home and make sure ’ inside only cat declawed cat lose their ability defend themselves from danger ’ glad sound like you aren’ board with declawing but please try and explain your ’ such barbaric practice and can’ understand why got popular ,1
cause why restrict cat movement get wrekt nerd ,1
pretty feral think doe fine ,1
are the bean blade ,1
yes bad just bad people say always declawed cat thought nothing one cat have wa declawed 2010 this day she still limp and hold one paw when she sits feel like crap realizing how bad wa for her honestly had idea the time but know ’ going get lot hate for this some cat are just destructive and cannot trained scratch the designated place ’ getting rid cat declawing would declaw not advocating jumping declaw cat just because definitely give the cat chance before even considering good friend mine had cat that wa just insane scratching thing she shredded curtain ruined drywall carpet furniture wa awful and friend did everything help mitigate the problem she finally had get her declawed and her kitty now she’ very loved and cared for ,1
love your ceramic tree and cat ,1
the vet where you work perform these surgery what they say about them ,1
problem hope help ,1
bdsm ,1
yeah they don even have ambush instinct cheetah are the only big cat that you can safely put your back the rest see opportunity ,1
have one declawed cat from birth and one not declawed home regret declawing because think our cat would’ been le stressed and depressed throughout her life ’ compared her behavior the cat living not declawed the same environment and even friend’ cat out all those cat ’ never met happy cat that wa declawed imagine living your human life without the tip your finger even though declawed our cat kitten can tell that she clear disadvantage survival wise and that ha had impact her mood whereas ’ never felt the same worry depressive behavior all not declawed cat and the majority other cat ’ met not declawed dozen took family take kitten that wa not declawed realize the decision made for our other cat your boyfriend and yourself decide forth with least realize decision you and your cat will have live with hope this help ,1
very pretty kitty ,1
that why start off all kitten rescue with claw clipping course husband the one who hold them while they struggle get away ,1
love that they all come out the same time ’ just smooth ,1
comfy ,1
they yes they prefer not the surgery older cat but believe doing young kitten better still not great because they’ young they don’ remember they age this the part wa wondering about but seems from the comment that doing kitten still just bad and can give them lasting effect ,1
they look like they about drop the last album 2018 ,1
switchblade kitty ,1
did you steal him from hemingway house ,1
just tried with cat and didn anything and just looked wondering what wa doing ,1
’ definitely talk him about ’ getting lot good argument against the comment perhaps our solution will find kitty that ha already been declawed and yes the cat will indoor only regardless ,1
oddly terrifying ,1
have cat who also stick his tongue out but only doe when ’ thirsty hot ,1
they totally can the vet don’ discus the lasting effect when someone asks about the surgery ,1
can understand you’ done absolutely everything that declawing may the only option it that rehoming but ’ talking about kitten fresh little mind that ’ going shape everyone who’ commented seems against and ’ getting lot good advice here thanks for your reply and thank you for loving and caring for your kitty long time ,1
think would safe say that you two can come agreement this then maybe don get cat that opinion tho cuz sound like would really hard one you for fulfilling whichever seems appropriate mean doesn feel can help train animal only scratch scratching post pad maybe just not ready own cat with you couldn understand your professional opinion about the pain and danger declawing that it not just taking the claw off then you need continue have this discussion ,1
it literally perfect ,1
think ’ like get one like that very cute ,1
leta ,1
she will eventually don worry ,1
thanks miss him much but happy that had such good long time together will always have soft spot for orange guy thanks him ,1
just keep she could scared hope she come home soon ,1

the problem the next closest vet about mile from ha issue with long car ride and ha defecated his carrier before from stress plus new vet isn going solve the problem him being terrified stranger would just end the same situation with new vet plus more stress from the car ride and from ,1
would think your vet would want what make you and your pet most comfortable something tell that drugging him won make him you more comfortable think would call the vet and ask you can one the other and tell them that this non negotiable this your pet and sedative aren safe for our kitty they are for especially inclined trust your gut instinct because you toxicologist say trust yourself you don feel comfortable and they won budge the two sedative maybe time find another vet ,1
this elphie short for elphaba year old cat had since she wa kitten and she the most loving and naughty cat have ever owned she always seems smile when you stroke her and she love belly rub ,1

’ very sorry for your loss may you forever cherish your memory her and may those memory bring you peace and comfort rest peace snuff ,1
mean you could post askvet although certainly not unreasonable ask for your cat sedated they don want deal with angry cat one time putting his food won give him association unless ha any other health problem that you haven discussed with your vet shouldn have any problem also how old doe avoid his carrier home ,1
use heated bed for cat they plug and are low energy using they just stay plugged all the time cat seem like them winter ordered pillow one and cup like one from foster and smith ,1
cat aren’ young but they’ all under leave the tree undecorated for couple day that they can get out their need curious with they pretty much ignore after decorate ,1
see wheat you did there ,1
something tell that drugging him won make him you more comfortable well that the thing that make uncomfortable don really know what will him basically going knock him out going feel sick etc mostly worried put food that won trust his food afterwards and then have eating issue top this only mentioned toxicologist give some reference familiarity with drug human that mean know what gabapentin and trazodone are because didn want come off like some uneducated uninformed guy who like them drug sound scary they must bad but have zero experience with sedating animal the only time schrodinger ha been sedated besides neutering surgery wa when needed have ray his lung believe they gave him buprenorphine for that and wa wobbly for few hour after got home until went bed wa fine the next morning ,1
tooteline rebby love you ,1
your story very funny make laugh and smile and yes agree too little motley group are the same yours ,1
thanks for sharing the legend wa awesome ,1
why cat like bag much mine the same thing ,1
certainly need rabies booster required state law would anyone ever find out likely not but the vet required give them didn get the shot would unable return the vet anyway ,1
not easy situation few thing consider ’ very wary give cat sedative just for quick vet visit for vaccine ’ already sedated why don’ they clean his teeth too for example the other thing cat vaccine usually last longer than year there have been study where the rabies vaccine safe give every three year and most other vaccine too only have german reference for that though then the other thing can kind understand where your vet coming from cat bite are very dangerous and out control cat can very hard handle you want through with giving him sedative then you could also try some fresh meat sausage ,1
doe eat while you pooping maybe you have your eat poop cycle synched but reverse ,1
that great idea thank you think those would work great their usual haunt ,1
doesn have any other health problem aware least any that the vet doesn know about ha possible case asthma went for few month where would cough every few day like wa hacking hairball but nothing ever come out year old issue with the carrier can pick him and put him with problem whatsoever leave open the floor will sit sleep chooses ha lot snoozing spot home the issue arises from his fear stranger have friend over will run and hide from them they try touch him will hiss and swat them this accelerated about 100x the vet office will not even let pick him there can lightly pet touch him the vet office but were try and remove him from the carrier will also hiss and bite ,1
right she stayed there for while too weirdo ,1
far just sniff the ornament hasn’ tried bat them off the tree but just sits under and stare and the sparkle like ’ the best thing ’ ever seen hahaha ,1
cool name for big fluffy cat buuuuuuuuurt ,1
best friend deal with the same thing with her cat awful the vet and ha sedated every time normal worried and concerned about though sorry ,1
see main concern also that upset while coming out really not sure how those specific drug are going affect him would need more information about that from vet were cat ,1
cat the same thing but they lay down foot always just assumed it because theyre giant attention whorea ,1
yes she absolutely fine now about week what mentioned the post with gradual improvement over day totally back normal now ,1
god they super cute ,1
cat like her liquid business when either girlfriend are the bathroom then she like make solid when ’ trying scoop the box definitely feel passive there ,1
two thing you don want mess with duck dungeon and cat the wall ,1
yes vet doe the same boy need the vet couple time month for glucose test and utis diabetes and sick being poked very growly crabby they now insist give him gabapentin relaxer prior visit didn mind first make easier for him deal with hell like damn relaxer for myself endure all the trip the vet usually fine but this week had slight reaction woozy for few hour but wa fine the next day ,1
few thing consider ’ very wary give cat sedative just for quick vet visit for vaccine ’ already sedated why don’ they clean his teeth too for example the other thing cat vaccine usually last longer than year there have been study where the rabies vaccine safe give every three year well usually just go and out for the shot and they don bother with the exam because stressed out wa sedated could get the full exam done maybe but also the mind that fuck paying them 100 for minute exam where they say look great and everything fine his teeth could probably use good scrub but again don know how sedated will and still skeptical that let anyone near his teeth ,1
know right ’ unbearable ,1
cat are the ultimate capitalist havent you played skyrim ,1
except when she steal spot ,1
crinkly stuff favorite cat ,1
that what talking about ,1
know how you feel could 5pm 12am seems poop right when sit down eat have small apartment and hidden litter box but stink the place ,1

she look just like girl saskia congrats the rescue she certainly look happy ,1
doesn’ anyone else wonder how you get that many cat stay still long enough for picture ,1
saw that cat when wa there year ago glad see still there ,1
what your plan then one cat deathly afraid other people but never hiss would just consider not feeding several hour before leaf then avoid the deification would least ask other vet see how they would handle this and they would still require the drug also maybe consider going for year rabies ha the vet le often cost lot more but something consider don sure you have facebook account but you there lot cat group out there that may provide help with more info ,1
clyde look like they will good pal ,1
obviously this why china can only invaded from the east ,1
tworedditors21characterlimits ,1
also maybe consider going for year rabies ha the vet le often cost lot more but something consider wa recommended against and verified with own searching the year shot because increased risk sarcoma the injection site don really have plan did see google there another vet little farther from about mile instead mile think going call them tomorrow and see what their opinion this vet also recommended maybe trying home visit they don them but they can recommend vet that doe which wa interesting but still felt like dead end because feel like his fear stranger isn going mitigated just because home although would much le stressful guessing ,1
take ,1
love your cat ,1
even cat have the slant eye asia ,1
brought kitten over visit mom and subsequently her cat and didn even approach the adult cat but the adult got pissed off that now even year later even though never visited again mom cat are lot pissy than they ever were before brought kitten visit girl cat even started peeing outside the box ,1
wa recommended against and verified with own searching the year shot because increased risk sarcoma the injection site would love read what you found cause that very old thought when say year talking about pure vax which non adjuvanted you should for non adjuvanted matter what but don know why year would increase sarcoma risk regardless would suggest home visit more expensive but remove some the complication you could always give him some lighter med calm him few day before have feliway diffuser going when the vet arrives ,1
that one smart cat ,1
sweet you sharing the basement with the owner cat rule thumb cat should okay but that level comfort change depending cat age coat length health etc 50f 10c your basement shouldn’ too cold for your average adult healthy cat but that being said cat probably prefer warmer ’ recommend getting heated cat bed cat bed with covering for them snuggle away heated cat bed these day are quite safe hope that help ,1

keeping your cat inside would responsible she will free from contracting disease like fiv and felv being harassed male cat being attacked animal tortured death cruel people and safe from dangerous roadway also she not fixed she will become pregnant and contribute the unwanted pet population which result the euthanasia million cat everyday ,1
one cat who look verrry similar yours also love hairties like the point that she hears hair rustle she come sneaking over looking steal one but careful because they eat them can cause fatal and very expensive damage their intestine don know from experience because kitty always very supervised even let her sniff hairtie get snatched away soon notice she ha one just psa but seriously though your cat super cute ,1
like mine shout lot when she hungry want somewhere want something she cant get obsessed with weird thing straw the toilet idk shes weird and she doesnt eat the straw just chew the end and bat them around the floor will kill man for some bread and sister proper princess hand her some treat unless it dreamies and she look hand and then look the floor put down human who you think one two facial expression startled rabbit unimpressed with life easily the most cuddly out the two ,1
make sure you deworm your cat nice are full worm and parasite that when consumed will spread your cat ,1

wa going say the same the other commenters sometimes cat that have known abuse their past still have personality difference with one cat and not another guess what mean that you see that there time when she seems really stressed the others then just separate them for bit just like when kid are having fuss simply step and give them little time apart two mine have bit personality clash and sometimes will catch them trying test the other just kind step and remove one safe place sometimes another room and then reunite them when they are both feeling calm ,1

gear the introduction unnecessarily long last for minute and half and ha something about bike ancient gear etc could way shorter and informative fact like the other intro you did them well the phrasing questionable “was the gear first invented men ” yeah wa the bug evolved couldn’ invent anything see what you are trying say but the way you say kinda weird why not “are the only specie that use gear ” something like that cat whisker the least clear topic out all three the least explained well which point their function crucial that cannot replaced eye ear nose some non script related stuff this part video and pic used are the most random you are showing production some random electronic part oil refinement facility surgery ’ quite confusing and what’ with the joke music your audience year old average the squid part wa fact good well explained well shown except for some strange squid with moon animation and video man having heart attack ,1

always find hair tie under the laundry box because she put them there and can get out then plus all the thing listed above like she hoarding them ,1
since the vet said she could potentially live two more year ask about administering subcutaneous fluid home not all cat are candidate for this but most chronic kidney disease patient are this can greatly improve the cat quality life and extend read and talk the vet you have actual blood test result you may want consult with askvet sure follow their submission rule and suspect you know this already but the human this story need help too hope you take the initiative find medical professional talk with who can help you regain balance and rebuild resiliance good luck with all this ,1

how about you try find the owner first instead just assuming there isn’ family missing their cat because you cant find any sign remember that illegal adopt yourself others roaming domestic animal unless you relinquish the animal local shelter they can attempt locate the owner microchip scanning tattoo identification and being the first location people missing pet check none are found after the designated hold time you can then adopt them take the animal the shelter they can take photo them scan for microchip look for tattoo write down any pertinent and unique marking they will then advise you that you can harbor the animal your residence long you your due diligence legal requirement which fulfilled regularly posting their photo neighborhood and online for full day owner located you may then adopt the animal yourself adopt out someone else relinquish the animal shelter rescue ,1

cat abby died from renal failure due complication with diabetes the hardest decision made wa deciding wa time according your vet you are not there yet sub fluid will perk your kitty and make want but first you need take care yourself eat and get some sleep ’ important that your kitty eats for long time wa feeding kitty syringe you may want talk with your vet about that but know helped kitty also the vet can guide you along with when ’ time front with them and say more test all the test confirm their diagnosis but not the outcome doesn’ really matter you can say and don’ feel bad about ask for palliative care also the fact that you are upset show you care and are good daddy ,1

first all while certain strand the flu can passed from human cat highly unlikely believe there wa case recorded swine flu being passed from cat owner and vice versa again very unlikely may indeed just the weather not treat your cat with any home remedy used treat cold flu symptom human suggest going the vet rule out any possibility infection and getting their input what most the time experience anyway simple kitty cold will away own having said that something like respiratory infection only get worse left itself you choose give another couple day keep very close eye loss appetite labored breathing coughing fatigue and general change behavior your cat the vet immediately any these thing start rise the sooner you catch the easier treat best wish you and your kitty hope you both get well soon ,1
think heart just exploded chest ,1

some cat take longer than others develop trust and some cat just don like touched love and patience the key keep doing what you are doing you have the chance watch cat from hell with jackson galaxy had cat over year and picked some good tip and trick from that show ,1
don take personally especially they are former ferals their nature wary everything their environment even after they spent time safe environment had some ferals and take long time for them come around usually one them took month and another took over year the current feral that have came around pretty quickly but that just his personality wa also able isolate him away from everyone else pet and human and slowly only pet them the head they are open you can try this giving them few treat and then give them scritch the head only give them treat under this scenario don give them the treat other time once they get used that you can start slowly move down the neck and then down the body and then the tail but this will take time patience and diligence you can never slow with cat good luck with you kitty and thank you for adopting them ,1
for sure they are pretty cheap under cat love first time squirrel ha gone there usually chickadee ,1

her first family had her declawed because she would scratch their child when they pulled her tail ugh this make mad the best solution would teach the child how handle animal even the cat wa mean anyway and scratched for reason declawing make cat more likely bite since you take away their first line defense they going use the next one and cat bite are far more dangerous than scratch due the bacteria their mouth better get scratch than bite any day thanks for adopting special cat x200b ,1

great pic the cat but would been better with dark background ,1
one parent cat had hematoma her ear several year ago the first vet visit wa similar yours antibiotic and gentle drain but quickly filled back and got bigger basically just made her comfortable she old lady too probably when this happened and tried keep her from shaking her head too much eventually wasn improving went emergency vet and drained hand pretty gross but kitty handled like champ barely even flinched wa happening sent home with some more med after that when still didn clear parent took her their normal vet again and they put drain her ear keep consistently draining for few day this required cone believe she wouldn pull out the equipment accident eventually though she healed they removed the drain and she wa all better her ear permanently crinkled now but otherwise damage anyway hope this somehow useful think the best thing keep kitty comfortable make sure they eating drinking and don afraid get second opinion you can ,1
this friendly reminder that accident and not accident downvote delete this comment ,1

she beauty ,1
best thing give him space just getting used new people and environment warm and sound like already ,1
you give picture would love try and practice with sorry about your dog passing ,1
mean large responsibility and obligation taking pet which why people say thing like that because you’ taking another life that you will care and provide for and that mean medical assistance will say though that also understand not having the fund and having work with what you can but the best suggestion have save money quickly possible and take the cat when you can research what around and see who ha the lowest rate stopped going vet year because found another vet that charge fraction the cost and doe great work cat have gone without regular flea medication before time where struggled they’ indoor though but have always been willing take the risk wa emergency someone wa truly sick surprisingly last visit the vet ended being much cheaper than expected ,1
thank you ❤ just love her much ,1
check for uti ,1
you send picture would love try and practice with maybe would turn out well sorry hear about your dog passing never easy losing someone love ,1
thank you are though wanted pet came and kept touching hand and did and cried happytears and now exploring our apartment happy warming ❤️ ,1
know that feeling strong and appreciate the moment you have together show your lovely cat how much you love him like guess you already did but even more don ever feel guilty else because know can happen you are great owner and sure grateful and happy have you ,1

see ’ neighborhood cat you want extra careful about being bitten and thank you for trying care for them not vet but the aspca cat book recommends that cat owner keep betadine and rubbing alcohol the internet suggests triple antibiotic ointment combination three antibiotic for cat and dog bacitracin neomycin and polymyxin used first aid for wound cat and dog popular dog and cat medication used treat bacterial infection minor cut burn scrape the skin the animal neosporin listed generic form although one vet point out that ’ illegal use medication off label fashion and say not use neosporin due possible side effects—there’ wealth conflicting info but figure having infected paw more likely harm understand this right you want wash the wound clean water and antiseptic solution soaking the paw hot water hot compress may help apply small amount antibiotic ointment and wrap the injured area with nonstick pad gauze bandage clean cloth using tape hold the bandage place repeat every day obligatorily again sorry not vet best take kitty vet possible ,1

pretty much figured much the hearing bud using are the cheapo kind that don self adjust mostly they are useful when late night watching and not wanting disturb hubby with the sound noticed that the screeching feedback sound make cat pay attention sit and look for the source and then into hunting mode with their superior hearing the screeching would probably like having jet engine blasting away about centimeter from your ear x200b case you have somehow triggered kind play interaction you take the bud out the case and initiate some sort game attention you may have deprogram her not paying attention giving feedback etc jackson galaxy speaks that more eloquently than can got cat figured out pretty good lol ,1

vet cannot tell you online how treat something they don’ know what that causing the problem and they could get their medical license taken away from them for tell you how treat doesn’ matter the antiseptic over the counter the law still prohibits them from telling you what looked your post history you were told contact your vet and you were politely explained why you should and why vet the internet could tell how treat the problem you were then nasty the mod via course they aren’ going give you the nicest response back the people over askvet are literally giving away free advice their free time sometimes the law prevents them from giving advice ’ not because they suck ’ because they could lose everything they give treatment advice sound like you still need the vet won’ “thousands dollars” for visit and some medication there are plenty vet that offer low cost visit give donated medication for free and their best help people your situation because they care about animal call around and ask for help ,1

long slow introduction think week minimum start with exchanging smell one cat room playing then the other cat the room playing this for few day once they are aware each other and seem with the other cat smell naughty peeing start feeding them separate room with door they can smell each other while eating slowly over few week bring them they are eating closer and closer threw the door one had issue open the door for feeding with lot space between them you have see three glass door that’ ideal cat can happily eat near each other they are tolerant each other also make sure your new kitten exhausted before any interaction with your older new cat this should continue for life because the older your cat get the more annoying the younger one have year old cat and year old kitten the young one are not played out few time day they stress older lady out they are played out then all can cuddle the bed issue younger cat have excess energy they tend see older cat toy and pester her when this happens have lot different toy use exhausted them take about min think cat store energy then release burst ’ not min action min action min rest min action min rest etc etc until both kitten are spent start with laser pointer because will make the kitty run and when they get bored with that give the toy they can physically grab onto and destroy during any introduction use toy and treat distract the cat seems going poorly also talk them lot cat are vain praise them husband ha chant sings for all our kitty and they all respond ear tail they preen like pageant girl when praise them hilarious also each cat should have their own litter box have cat and litter box different location and they still get stupid over them sometimes seems like lot work but ’ great when all your kitty can cuddle around you and happily together husband office ha like cat bed and wall perch and all the cat stay will him while code all day the only thing that change the cat rotate position one more thing each cat should have real estate like have few bed and scratching post that they claim invest some those more then one cat are surprisingly materialistic cat can get territorial over some stupid thing female each fight over one corner the couch have huge couch but they both wanted that one corner that look into the kitchen had get wall perch now both cat have place sit and spy the kitchen ,1
can offer advice would suggest using the nature the cat your advantage felis catus very scent oriented group cat and their human develop group family scent this why they rub head and sniff each other with greeting exchanging scent for your situation would suggest keeping the kitten isolated for few more day begin introducing item from the kitten room the reluctant established cat they can get used the new group smell allowing short interaction sharing scented item and general slow introduction prove work best ,1
slow intro through baby gate take something the older kitty ha been laying and leave the room you have new kitty the same thing for older kitty something with new kitty scent food dish same hall but far apart they get used each other move the dish closer together over time give lot love both kitty play with both them ,1

understand ’ hard when your pet are sick and fund are limited sometimes ’ also hard gauge tone over the internet know many vet have differing opinion how much money you should have pet owner but honestly ’ seen rich people not want spend penny the second their pet need more than the basic the flip side ’ seen people without dollar their name try everything they can pay for treatment sometimes the everyday grind being vet get people get exhausting want everything you can treat patient only have the owner say “ can’” “ don’ want ” think some vet handle the “ can’” very well and find way treat within the client’ mean and other vet just don’ handle that well because break them they blame themselves the owner vet don’ make lot money for the amount schooling they especially when you compare our friend and they would bankrupt very fast they treated animal for free ’ really hard reconcile that and feel like good vet the end the day thank you for caring about your pet and doing what you can keep them fed and healthy ,1

the “story” about the woman denying water actually about dog not cat there are many “stories” about prophet muhammad’ pbuh love for cat though you’ right ’ muslim and love both dog and cat can’ help but pet good doggo when see one just have wash hand after pet dog able the prayer service dog are considered dirty whereas cat are considered clean since they pretty good job cleaning themselves dog house would make really hard the prayer service that house because would difficult keep the house and yourself clean but that doe not mean you cannot like them care for them muslim should show compassion and mercy towards all that created him ,1

dont worry they will both fine offer lap time and pet they will get over ,1
islam dog are considered dirty but you not allowed mistreat animal specifying that dog aren clean because praying muslim must completely clean when they pray they perform ablution before every prayer and they must clean themselves again they certain thing take shit fart bleed vomit sleep etc they touch dog they must perform ablution again however muslim aren allowed mistreat any animal they cannot kill animal unless for food for self defence they can harm harass animal they are heavily encouraged provide food and water hungry thirsty animal there are few other rule but don know them islam fine with keeping dog pet especially they are used for work during the time the prophet this would refer guard dog and hunting dog not used for work they are still allowed but discouraged due cleanliness ,1

last two cat had catflap and they spent their time outside willingly usually right the flower bed sleeping most the day will put out shelter for them they change their mind when are work and summer day leave opening inside for them wa dog 100 agree but cat are nature more independent and don need 24hr supervision course varies personality but will try find cat that suitable for opposed one with anxiety have been part owner cat with separation anxiety have seen cat live family with routine and just fine they know come home the same time the owner the local shelter recently had capacity exploded due hoarder bust really want help them offload ,1
catnip lot and lot catnip also just treat general cat hate bath time but tolerates because know good give him bite taco similar treat after dry off also hate his worm treatment that get every time any animal the house get worm but just give him catnip and pin him down and make him take and chill keep mind have scar from this cat because pissed him off not like just gentle lil guy treat and bribery work well ,1
nether cat show any interest the nip sadly ,1
savage ,1
cat are the easiest just leave out some food and water and change the litter you could leave for week and long food and water wa left out that cat wouldn’ bat lash that’ too much you shouldn’ get pet ,1
definitely not let your cat out contrary what people often think they not mind living indoors not safe world for house cat all take stray dog car other tragedy and they can hurt killed ,1
want this starbucks and pet all the cat ,1
used have cat that went out when pleased lived 1st floor apartment that 2nd floor for american used leave the window open every now and then and she jump out onto the little roof then onto the fence and will always come home the same day apart from few time where she come back the next morning lot people object this but she wa happy and wa really good shape think you should wait while until she get used your home before letting her out though and keep top regular flea treatment there the increased risk her getting into accident but there also the risk obesity and boredom for indoor cat there right wrong answer ,1
pretty sure the prophet muhammad had beloved cat there’ thatま ,1
they don have super sensitive tummy non spicy taco hamburger with barely any seasoning great with cat drain much grease can off the meat even rinsing before seasoning and only give him single bite not normally good for cat obviously and don recommend taco per say because cat ha pretty much iron stomach just treat cat can eat whole mexican pizza from taco bell and fine though don give them him sneaky lil bastard get big trouble for believe not good for cat give them mexican food even though alduin can handle doubt most cat can his father grew chili dog taco are idea their stomach can handle though ,1

would say that due islam indirectly today turkey the respect and care for cat ha been around for century turkey and back then wa probably more because religious reason this from the memoir baron wenceslas wratislow published 1599 “ constantinople there are also large garden surrounded with wall which cat jump and assemble waiting for certain people come and give them alms for customary for turk boil and bake paunch light liver and piece meat and carry them wooden bucket and down the city cry out ‘kedi kedi ’ ‘cat’ meat ’… and undoubted truth that the wall these garden the cat breakfast the morning and assemble for the second time the hour the evening meal large body out the whole city and stand the lookout and went purposely these wall and listened their caterwauling and watched how they ran out the house and assembled ” ,1
could ive done before but know the meat raise home had happy life and there were loved and very well cared for anyone who ha done this will tell you home raised rib eye filliet die for and raiseing chicken for the table and the meat yellow you know they had life where they could run around and chicken ,1

this very common bottle baby ehavior problem you need teach her how play when she start biting scratching remove her and use loud form tap her the forehead you need firm consistant you see her start bite say stop and she doesn remove she doe give her praise and love often time cat will bite say nooooo and when they stop and begin licking just stop entirely consistant and patient she won learn overnight but you need her teacher and let her know what and isn play love ,1
she may very well not like cuddle picked pet cat friendly— will sit with and follow around but generally isn’ fond being picked pet doesn’ bite but will run away from lol for cat discipline you will would certainly have gentle water spray bottle and spray the cat you’ not hurting the cat you’ just annoying and inconveniencing them which should eventually translate the cat wanting avoid the water they’ avoid the biting behavior you must consistent though again the lack biting and clawing cannot promise your cat will cuddle with you some cat just don’ dig but can express their love other way may that your cat even trying play but she’ playing too rough and need learn that isn’ acceptable your cat being meanie head and need stop lol your cat show good behavior sure give treat how long have you had this cat definitely spray water when attack’ your other cat poor thing had this happen once didn’ use spray bottle but said “ ” very loudly and pushed not rough anything the mean cat away and picked the cat that wa the victim away andpetted her and gave her treat that cat didn’ like loud sound wa such dick other cat but eventually settled but took time now ’ real sweetheart and they get along dont know this work for all cat but worked for mine the other cat were always friendly that’ only experience ,1

well biggest problem that teaser can open our door really hoping that won’ need keep them separated too long otherwise will have figure way can get the door open when needed but teaser can’ but ’ nice hear that they are get along better over time just really want avoid having home the kitten because that can very stressful for cat will defiantly using the separate space where they can hear and smell each other though that seems the best way when indroducing cat each other ,1
nice color fur and eye ,1
keep your new baby separate from your other three cat just case there ring worm other thing contagious until you can get the vet thing like ring worm can spread and between cat for month keep the kitten warm and maybe one room they aren’ overwhelmed and feel safe towel blanket and social interaction until vet and mixing water with wet food dry food get more water the kitty’ system ,1

man had much fun going tiny dog show few month ago all the dog were calm and got see lagottos which have never seen irl before ,0
amazing how have these magical transportation device that can take area not our own and phone that can get contact with other human ,0
the kind dog person chooses more reflection what that person want from pet than anything else there are lot reason for choosing lower maintenance dog know quite few people who have interesting demanding career and involvement with other demanding hobby and activity and they specifically chose le active dog because they enjoy dog but aren’ prepared expend the time energy and resource required manage say border collie jack russell ,0
also post this askavet mobile not sure this link they are really good community with lot useful knowledge ,0
thanks trying gosh even dog lover irks when people make excuse instead correcting their dog need teach dog behave way that nonthreatening and consistent reinforcement could apologize behalf all passive dog owner would you very patient and understanding person when you first turn away likely bark you try get your attention again going feel like year but eventually stop barking once you ignore him long enough the shelter our general rule wa that you don acknowledge the dog until she quiet and ha all four paw the ground some dog figured out second others took forever dog persisted barking just left their room kennel and returned once they were quiet they started again repeated the process very time consuming but even the most stubborn dog eventually figured out that she needed settle get attention ever get overwhelming leaving the room always option good luck you that awesome that you already have him doing trick nice job yes training trick excellent way for you bond and build confidence your comfort level with him will increase significantly you both work together toward common goal again ever get out hand leaving him time out for him always option but think you find that want you stick around and his behavior will improve given that already happy cuddling with you think you two are your way becoming good friend you got this ,0
polly and esther ,0
cousin said wa the water for while but wasn complaining when they took him out finally collapsed and his stomach wa huge they realized wa basically drowning could not walk and wa spouting water from his nose mouth his stomach still plump and out but can walk now induced vomiting with bit hydrogen peroxide and also peeing lot clear like water read online that slowly giving salt can help with lost sodium pound ,0

not worry probably just fine dog are naturally prone eating junk like road kill probably wondered why you were upset maybe thinking you wanted and their system are geared eat stuff that would very sick over and doesn agree with them they will usually just barf even dog doe get worm from eating carrion will usually start eating thing like grass dispel the worm naturally what they aren adapted for poison sister dog ate road kill coyote that had probably gotten hit because wa dying her dog got very sick but her vet pulled him through ,0
why are the cutest dog always mixed ,0
askvets ,0
can call bullshit this from argentina and know nowhere hour away car from city longest nowhere route 300km long and nobody life there ,0
sadly would not able the vet area due cost lack car and work use the computer cafe use internet due bad phone service ,0
more pic love his coloring ,0
’ going have really take back the cargo pant suggestion the case you’ made against being compelling that can only concede ,0
she ended going bed when woke found some diarrhea decided take her the vet that’ open for check they said that since had been hour ’ probably normal that she’ got weird bowel movement and hyper but she won’ die they gave her some fluid and sent her her way think she’ doing okay ,0
fully understand that but the original idea that just because your town doesn have vet mean they are fully inaccessible ludicrous you have option available such getting contact with other type vet like livestock vet vet willing come you you can send email vet and ask them for assistance the matter they know anyone else the area that can help cannot diagnose your dog over the internet crucial that you get some kind professional involved the matter some point look like you given her comfort for now but that doesn mean the condition gone she isn still danger ,0
interesting look there may multiple study yours seems only involve golden retriever wa thinking this quote most dog being diagnosed with dcm not have low taurine level some owner continue feed beg diet but supplement taurine thinking that this will reduce their risk for heart disease our hospital currently measure taurine all dog with dcm but more than our patient with dcm which taurine ha been measured have normal level and the majority are eating beg diet yet some these dog with dcm and normal taurine level improve when their diet are changed this suggests that there’ something else playing role most case – either deficiency different nutrient even toxicity that may associated with beg diet giving taurine unlikely prevent dcm unless your dog ha taurine deficiency and given the lack quality control for dietary supplement you can introduce new risk your dog you give supplement without evidence that she need from this link ,0
dog doe hump one his fixed friend they don smell like like the make hormone than anymore they think that they are female think idk your dog fixed but else would maybe that ,0
ehh look like backyard breeder they heath testing but also seem breed dog young and also mention what they with their dog prove there even worth breeding confo agility etc you can def better ,0
thanks for the suggestion haven’ consider fostering only because think ’ have hard time giving the dog this ha been more passing thought here and there guy kind fell lap had friend who got him puppy and wa just too big for her and her son 70ish lb month 120lbs now golden pyrenees gladly adopted him getting another ha been something ’ considered but haven’ actively pursued guess figure the right circumstance present itself ’ decide then did the shelter route would probably look for older dog that had le likely chance being adopted with the hope she wa already house trained and maybe little le energetic guy really chill and wouldn’ want disrupt his way life either ,0
are considering getting him fixed next week but not sure will stop the humping ,0
this condition being looked variety research and university still have lot learn about but the safest option this point look for feed that ha been through trial that seems safer route the reason golden retriever were high interest for this study that they aren breed that ha history with dcm relatively new condition the breed meaning something recent year ha changed and feed the main suspect here really crazy fascinating situation right now and there lot pretty good theory out there why happening have way before there definite consensus what causing even multiple factor are causing ,0
local doctor and google said use salt right quantity throughout the day treat loss sodium the dog pee and vomit also gave stuff meant him pee more his stomach area and rib are better but still tight think would dead without the thing did apparently collapsed after being taken out looked dead when saw him just not moving and letting out steady cry could not walk because his belly wa full water hope will fine but google and the doctor said there can still huge issue with organ and the brain glad not cry anymore and walking ,0
yeah and wouldn recommend long term either simple diet just rice and chicken and couple veggie not enough nutrient for good health long term ,0
keep them separated for the time being ,0
they can really picky sometimes they are smart that association can really hard break ,0
how you know ha hyponatremia did have some lab work your description his tight full stomach sound like bloat ,0
“bloat” like volvulus common big dog ,0
would avoid them they health testing which wonderful but they advertise championship line without their own dog being titled and appears they only use their own dam sire usually good breeder want make sure increase genetic diversity and will pay for stud ,0
spaghetti000s how going now month later experiencing some serious puppy depression only had week old puppy for only day and feel overwhelmed and exhausted physically and mentally love hear how going for you month thanks ,0
believe the vet tell her went today and she looked her dead the eye and said ‘two meal day’ grandmother ha proceeded say the vet wrong grandfather and follow whatever are told pup’ vet weigh his food etc grandmother think the professional wrong ,0
that sound like recovering good luck you the stuff pee more called diuretic ,0
make sure try get slot salt into him hyponatremia the imbalance the salt water ratio the body ,0
’ askvet ,0
go out with 7am 30am get take the little woofer out ’ the grandmother she wait until 11am ’ darn good boy don’ mind getting let him out need the pup need ,0
ooops thank you ,0
know you said your dog smaller and typically this occurs larger dog but possible your dog ha bloat and this isn’ related the water all how soon wa the water swimming after eating this can cause some the same symptom you’ describing though usually occurs larger dog otherwise sound like improving based your comment human have worry about replenishing sodium too quickly typically this because ’ giving fluid your dog belly start feel better ’ hopefully want take more mouth and you can continue with small salty snack hyponatremia when severe can cause neurological symptom some lethargy and weakness too expected but continues might worried seizure are the ultimate concern disclaimer ’ dog owner and human nurse not anything vet related good luck ,0
went the vet today and grandmother ha been told she overfeeds him she’ disputing this and saying ’ ‘cruel’ feed him only two meal day unfortunately she treat him like child and not dog she’ food orientated and us the dog justify snacking massive issue here she’ share with him have suspicion she feed him secret which ’ not too sure how combat ,0
just keep them physically separated for least several day ’ actually fairly common for pet react badly when housemate pet come back from the vet ill injured probably ha something with unfamiliar smell among other thing ,0
honestly really difficult tell what breed mixed puppy may because this age lot trait are pretty neutral and common with other breed well where did you get the puppy from did you let your daughter spend time with the puppy before bringing him home see she reacted this point you have the puppy you have and think the more important issue here keep close eye your daughter and see how she reacts the puppy even dog that are low shed and low dander can cause reaction the best you can right now monitor and see how thing between them ,0
lol cat lily sound like old jewish woman from new york who constantly kvetching rico the french bulldog sound like tough gangster from bay ridge who also got heart gold ,0
look the dog and it personality then decide once got dog that wa named rumpelstiltskin it owner she called him rumple horrible when bought him noticed right away that his ear rotated whenever there wa sound talking renamed him radar other hint name the dog one two syllable word with hard consonant like and that they can hear you better when they get out bound and not name them person name had friend whose dog wa named nancy and then she went work for person named nancy then the dog had renamed ,0
alright ’ looking around for some profesional help thank you for your help ,0
thank you ,0
you could ironic name like tiny teacup some personal favorite are apollo bear vinnie amazon and liberty some more common name would include buddy bella jake bailey max rocky ,0
thank you much will that until can get the dog fixed ,0
you should edit your original post ,0
yeah noticed that too they include the parent pedigree and everything but doesn seem like they show their dog wouldn matter much since looking for healthy pet and not show dog but put off the wording certainly been more difficult than thought finding good breeder the area ,0
they misspell “conformation” “confirmation” the application rookie mistake “championship line ” as ,0
should stop the humping plus you should anyway you are having behavioural issue with aggression and intact that will snap him out and will almost certainly stop with out them ,0
askvet not askvets please consider editing your post ,0
live turbio the vet rio gallegos and calafate are closed don have vet livestock doctor closest open vet could find are hour away the coast and family cannot take there ,0
yes she came with see him before took him home and didn have reaction then planning monitoring for awhile before make any decision but already pretty attached him crossing finger they ,0
there are ton supplement marketed for that indication the catch that none them work talk your vet about medical and feeding option ,0
you not understand are hour away from large city and the vet are closed first thing did wa call the vet but the office were closed then called the doctor and posted here for any other tip vet would come here and town very small this needed immediate attention and did send email but response far because office are closed and sure take while not everyone ha access the luxury the west don even have internet always ,0
their vet are anything like they are the they won’ diagnose your dog over the phone ’ standard practice they’ have see the dog also the vet several hour away would cost arm and leg get home visit that’ probably out the question other than that ’ seen ton smart people here that know what they’ talking about try help these board whenever can think ha done all they can for now they sound like they have the situation under control unless something else crazy happens murphy’ law glorious thing ,0
called they ,0
thank you much will most definitely getting him fixed and will keep them separated until then ,0
you haven bathed the puppy yet you should she might have been reacting some other allergen the dog ,0
same surgery like that joke especially 8yo gsd husky and the long recovery picnic either based that information alone mom come across very committed the dog’ well being given your mom’ dedication the dog’ care and that the decision wa made after consulting with vet everything seems indicate that euthanasia wa appropriate decision under the circumstance ’ sorry for your loss ,0
unless you are training recall having the dog stand perfectly still still safety issue for the dog and other people and animal who may the vicinity just the other day while were the vet young spaniel came with giant tear from taking off lightweight long line and getting tangled ten stitch later wa expensive lesson for the owner ,0
beautiful what fortunate dog have such determined selfless loving owner that all any dog need keep and update with all your progress cute pupper ,0
vet the will help you the best their ability over the phone course their best advice going being them but ’ personally watched the vet work for what they can emergency situation where transporting the animal not option not discount getting consultation over the phone especially ’ your only option that time ,0
understand your situation perfectly you’ doing the best with what you have ,0
venture say that adopting one the calmest gentlest breed starting out small especially puppy then quite literally starting out small expecting his whole family sacrifice getting something that they want because his issue make him the selfish one you ask ,0
use long line and reel her when you recall reward when she back you with toy food and then tell her sniff she can self reward the environment rinse and repeat off leash time until maturity and you can guarantee the return ,0
have you tried using high value treat get his attention away from the other dog have you figured out how close the other dog you can get before yours start have reaction both those thing may help you more than resorting picking the dog when this happens have reactive small dog myself and there have been few time felt necessary pick him and quickly remove him from the situation but our first resort always use his special treat keep him focused try get more distance from the other dog wait for the other dog pas have heard that picking the dog can more dangerous mean you risking turning it aggression you for one thing and stray off leash aggressive dog running you picking your dog you essentially getting the middle fight and could definitely make thing worse yeah generally preferable leave your dog the ground point reactivity but you should also trying get him more distance from the other dog the same time would recommend you try out the treat thing high value stuff that only get around other dog and also head over reactivedogs for more help most important that you start treating your dog soon another dog sight but before over his threshhold and the point where reacting say start when you see dog across the street that okay distance for your pup the more often you treat him these scenario the more start associate other dog positive thing instead something ha freak out over treat our dog simply for responding his name and looking when another dog around you should find that your dog threshhold get smaller over time though some dog never well with actual leash greeting also make point warning other dog owner passing that dog need space feel like they might try bring their dog for introduction ,0
poor but consistent english the description perfect english reply with you ,0
have chain lead that she can bite and retractable one could just link them together have one 10m lead ,0
fixed much appreciated bonerforjustice ,0
don session and but carry your clicker around and capture behavior just during life also keep your session short you them and use life reward like sniffing other self rewarding behavior far time depends the dog going longer than puppy because you have dog that already ha behavior and you need undo them shift them around little fit them into what you would prefer ,0

firstly thanks for such depth answer have had two experience with dog actually getting close with another leashed dog slipped out his collar both time hence why upgraded harness the first time wa full rage mode but when actually approached the dog they sniffed each other began wagging tail and were playing together however the second time the other dog reacted aggressively well and fight ensued lucky managed separate before any injury will say this rare though usually the other dog like luckily never turned aggressive towards just gotten the occasional scratch from his nail since squirming hard tends stiff soon see another dog but doesn start raging until they are pretty much walking past dog doesn seem hugely food motivated but definitely give that try and peep around that subreddit for some extra advice thanks again ,0

you can cue anything any time prefer using cue word over clicker simply because always have voice handy but you can also use cue word tandem with the click the beauty clicker training that eventually just the cue itself give the dog bump dopamine the same way apps train with notification game train with sound for getting reward leveling you can not only cue for anything any time you can cue whenever your dog doe something desirable like cueing for relaxed calm behavior random and cue when dog look during walk for particularly excellent job heeling the dog should quickly learn that whatever they’ doing the moment you cue desirable and rewarding which why clicker training all about precise training cueing also give you forgiving timeline fetch treat because you can cue good behavior and then follow with treat instead having give the treat soon the behavior achieved ,0

best advice patient and understanding possible and think any incident run in that may occur from the dog’ perspective ’ found that the best thing you can dog owner consider their perspective and find way work don’ even fret about the first night either ’ weird adjustment night for everyone involved but ’ work out matter day had our dog and year old for and year when decided add another into the mix the first night wa group effort because our oldest wa dog aggressive her youth but still ha some residual guarding issue kept all dog separated and leash the house until about day when wa clear that they were all interested being friend this helped lot because they got used each others’ scent before they had actually hang out also walked them together day and that proved great for bonding now month later the three them are bonded and everything together really weren’ sure how the first night would but turned out better than could’ hoped ,0

why you think corn low quality ingredient and what are the other low quality ingredient you referencing corn significant source protein healthy fat and vitamin carbohydrate electrolyte and potassium corn oil also one the best source linoleic acid required for healthy skin and coat “ heard concern about them grain being ‘filler ’ which nonsense ” larsen say “they are added because they contribute energy and other essential nutrient well very useful dietary component such fiber which underappreciated nutrient ” buster corn edition aspx reality corn provides nutritious affordable source carbohydrate for energy essential amino and fatty acid for healthy skin coat and immune system function and variety other nutrient these nutrient are released during the manufacturing process and are easily absorbed and utilized when included complete diet and misconception surrounding pet food ,0
what off the shelf food would you consider better than pro plan sensitive skin stomach and why allergy are hard and best treated vet otc remedy are notoriously ineffective and there are effective prescription med that can help also might not allergy could caused any number thing and messing around with random treatment from people the internet may just make thing worse and cost more fix when the vet finally get involved ,0

not that think corn the awful ingredient that some make out more that think there are only going set ingredient any dog food therefore each ingredient that make into the list should justified problem with corn that compared many other food take meat btw dog are carnivore that lacking many nutrient that meat contains compare the nutrient you said that corn ha chicken chicken ha niacin protein selenium vitamin vitamin b12 phosphorus choline pantothentic acid etc plus fish just good for coat argue while providing those bonus nutrient compared corn not that think corn completely useless just not loaded with nutrient compared other more expensive ingredient that could added it place also can you please explain how grinding corn make more digestible honest question heard that lot and guess don understand mean human chew corn and everything else pretty thoroughly effectively grinding but one claiming can digest any more efficiently after chewing know that dog only have between and seems that scientist can make their mind that misunderstanding the article gene for digesting carbohydrate think just because they can bit doesn mean optimal food for them ,0
since there are multiple problem would see veterinary behaviourist not trainer who call themselves behaviourist few session with them may help you understand the underlying cause the behaviour and come with alternative way about resolving them aside dog don understand use generalized sense they need one word for one action want from them for example your dog jump the sofa say mean nothing unless they are scared you then they panic but you say the same phrase word which ha desired action associated they are likely with training that action when requested this case might dog name get off then they know what you want not sure that make sense for the immediate future could you grab few poop bag when you don have the dog with you then take them the wall then carry the full bag till you get bin you can reach without him going the grass mulch but long term behaviourist will able help you find way resolve the dog issue for dog when she won take treat indication she over threshold forcing your dog over threshold multiple time day called flooding and can have negative consequence can say from your post whether this what happening here but might ,0

yes she follows the command much more reliably when she seek into the room with the treat and grab the clicker outside that doesn’ seem like the cue mean anything her ,0
think that random event and not likely make the toy any more dangerous for the next person who buy one good find though ,0
dog are really different some need you harsh others really into themselves when you harsh not talking about physical harshness but mental kind learnt from dog that there basically zero point telling them off for something that happened while ago you come home something you love ripped the natural thing however not effective clean what they done front them can and try make sure they see but don tell them off you get some nutter dog where all good training idea out the window though found that especially with driving with one she our wonderful lab now who generally well behaved but when got her she wa impossible the car admit punched her the nose few time not hard but not soft when she did egregious thing also checked mirror and did emergency stop could and told her off ,0
therefore each ingredient that make into the list should justified listed lot reason for including corn above and many not all dog food that use corn explain why they use dog are carnivore source compare the nutrient you said that corn ha chicken why nobody recommending that you feed only corn just that corn ha many benefit that make great ingredient not that ha many benefit only feed corn let compare chicken egg egg have biological value 100 why aren feeding our dog only egg plus fish just good for coat fish wonderful source omega not linoleic acid essential nutrient are those that animal can’ make their own and must get from food the fatty acid linoleic acid omega fatty acid essential for all animal animal that don’ get enough linoleic acid can develop number health problem like poor skin and haircoat abnormal growth young animal and weakened immune system you can see the table ranking the best source linoleic acid here also can you please explain how grinding corn make more digestible remove the shell leaving the nutrient rich inside that incredibly digestible when eat corn don digest the shell either but instead digest the inside the grain think just because they can bit doesn mean optimal food for them how doe gene for digesting carbohydrate that are expressed much higher level than wolf they can bit and why the conclusion that not optimal would love see the source you have backing the statement you made about nutrition ,0
puppy ate half pound chocolate and wa fine just made him ridiculously hyper for bit ,0

using clicker maker word great for teaching dog desired behavior but then once your dog consistently offering the desired behavior you want add cue and proof that behavior first adding cue this the word gesture you going tell your dog perform specific behavior which they then rewarded for dog usually learn gesture more easily than word you having difficulty try that usually add cue when 100 happy with how dog performing the behavior and offering extremely consistently then just start using the cue shortly before likely offer the behavior simultaneously when wa first learning gradually cue earlier and earlier until consistently responds the cue with the behavior this point usually fade the clicker still rewarded just stop marking once your dog offer the behavior cue then time proof think few thing while proofing sometimes known the but have more haha distraction duration distance discrimination diversification for sit this might look like distraction can dog sit while toy the floor what about treat another dog person outside near busy road duration how long can dog sit can sit until release him however long that distance how far away will still understand can cue from 2ft 20ft discrimination how well doe know sit cue can switch between sit and down sit and stand diversification where when can dog perform this cue night when tired when excited for breakfast all the room house the room friend house you want add these proof very very gradually and make easy for your dog successful for distraction first might ask dog sit move foot slightly then immediately give him treat didn move put kibble the floor where can prevent him from grabbing etc very easy simple change then gradually make harder—step backwards put better treat the floor drop treat from bounce etc sorry for the long response but hope this help ,0

that’ why the dog perfectly capable eating grain based diet most commercially fed dog the conclusion dog are perfectly capable eating grain based diet mean they even evolved able eat that type diet not seeing any reason why they can thrive diet with grain never once claimed that any pet food company would suggest only feeding one ingredient have idea what you about there highlight what actually wrote more that think there are only going set ingredient any dog food therefore each ingredient that make into the list should justified correct and corn justified because it many benefit what wa the purpose comparing corn and chicken thought wa obvious that meant fish oil wa excellent for skin and coat while the fish provides number other ingredient compared the modest amount nutrient you mentioned that were corn but doesn provide linoleic acid which essential for coat and skin health sure fish great but they still missing omega and while can come from other ingredient corn oil the best source corn also provides number other ingredient have read more about linoleic acid can you tell where cat being obligate carnivore obtain this nutrient the wild idea don know much about cat nutrition know they don process linoleic acid the same way dog they have gene not like the one article read even le gene that thought and what doe le gene mean their gene are more efficient than wolf digesting carbs clearly number doesn matter can you prove that grain are more optimal than meat again with comparing different food they not more optimal than meat they provide nutrient and vitamin along side meat which also provides nutrient and vitamin would never just feed dog meat any unnamed protein source meat and bone meal animal fat etc food dye high fructose corn syrup husk hull etc why the dog food that think are the best are the one that have been through feeding trial show that they are providing dog with everything they need food that are researched based and have consistent quality control otherwise any diet that ha been created for the individual dog with the assistance veterinary nutritionist where blood work and other measure are taken ensure appropriate diet for the dog ,0

breeder won sell someone who say they picked poodle because allergy until they actually come and visit see their allergy are triggered poodle many people don get that you can allergic poodle ,0
knew how quote stuff too that would lot easier well yes they are perfectly capable eating perfectly capable eating cardboard doesn mean optimal unfortunately long term study raw food diet have been performed knowledge the answer really just don know which diet optimal until more long term study are done with more type dog food hence the debate the reason that compared that for some dog food company either thing can use corn can use meat which why compared see from your last paragraph you must fan the big purina royal canin and hill let use this example purina shall this alpo prime cut savory beef flavor dry dog food ingredient ground yellow corn meat and bone meal soybean meal beef tallow preserved with mixed tocopherol form vitamin corn gluten meal egg and chicken flavor animal digest salt potassium chloride choline chloride red zinc sulfate ferrous sulfate vitamin supplement yellow manganese sulfate blue lysine monohydrochloride niacin vitamin supplement copper sulfate calcium pantothenate garlic oil pyridoxine hydrochloride vitamin supplement thiamine mononitrate vitamin supplement riboflavin supplement calcium iodate menadione sodium bisulfite complex source vitamin activity folic acid biotin sodium selenite see that ground yellow corn according purina research and science wa deemed important needed the ingredient never mind that think the meat and bone meal would actually due having already lost moisture content but digress ground yellow corn which ha lot le nutrient than meat the first thing see the bag what purina justification for using corn over something with more nutrient say chicken meal they the one making the claim not they also think dog can see color forgive being skeptical their science secondly you said they have consistent quality control well let look the second ingredient meat and bone meal now according aafco meat and bone meal and quote unlike meat and meat product this ingredient may from mammal other than cattle pig sheep goat without further description however manufacturer may designate specie appropriate such beef meal only from cattle according aafco this can from any mammal let ignore the scary possibility and let assume that one batch from lamb and the next from cow know that lamb low taurine and with this ingredient 2nd the list can probably assume feature quite prominently this food wouldn inconsistent batch because remember purina can even tell what specie this dog food euthanized horse run over raccoon llama how than can this blend dog food contain all the necessary nutrient the precisely correct balance cannot even tell what own ingredient yes key word being more efficient than wolf how much more know wolf are pretty terrible without point reference how many gene human have for example really can answer that question and haven seen anything convincing from veterinary nutritionist the subject either eta googled human have between gene the typical human ha six lower gene obviously equal le ability dog are roughly half good are digesting carbohydrate once again never claimed one should just feed meat not nutritionist don know what exact level carbohydrate protein ratio dog should eating but you are saying position dog food place meat justified asking you state why more optimal than the chicken meal that could have gone into that bag place this interesting feed diamond natural grain free according some veterinary nutritionist fallen for clever marketing guess didn notice all the diamond natural commercial but cursory glance youtube show quite the marketing from purina also they are somehow appealing emotion can anyone explain that let look the faq section purina chewy com for their moist meaty burger with cheddar cheese flavor dry dog food for why they add artificial dye their dog food why doe your dog and cat food contain color although dog and cat are unable distinguish color know that most pet owner consider the product’ appearance when purchasing food for their pet artificial coloring added maintain more desirable and consistent appearance all coloring used our pet food are approved for use the food and drug administration fda dunno between the title the food burger and cheese and the know your dog doesn care what color food because can assure you dog most certainly can see color despite what purina would have you believe they seem blatantly marketing and appealing emotion unfortunately the feed trial requirement from aafco quite low only dog required and only complete the feeding trial only last week the big company mentioned longer study know that diamond natural doe some testing their dog but they keep minimum due animal welfare concern also your logic about corn you said don digest the shell very well can you explain why the soybean hull found purina cat chow indoor cat food would somehow more digestible than the corn hull you discussed your earlier comment also didn think need explain why think corn syrup bad ingredient dog food but here are excessive amount corn syrup can also cause obesity and diabetes this ingredient sweetener but your dog doesn need corn syrup other sugar their food achieve nutritional balance from again where the justification for this ingredient place say chicken meal spinach anything else really ,0

agree you honestly don’ have the time take care the dog such letting out for potty break feeding them during the day giving enough exercise and play with the dog affection and mental stimulation then you are just one the people who aren’ fitted dog owner for now why rob the dog’ opportunity live with someone family who can better provide for them with all the care and love they deserve however thing may change the future where you are capable have time the thing ’ mentioned ’ not saying you have attached the hip but hour too long maybe wait till your schedule isn’ demanding because taking care dog very demanding itself and requires lot time and effort you decide ‘ dammit ’ still getting dog regardless time constraints’ then really suggest planning full support system family friend reliable and credible doggy daycare walker sitter take care your dog for you during the day and you take over night for breed guess anyone who low maintenance and independent meaning they don’ have always rely you for comfort maybe they can just grab their favorite toy and lay corner way chill ,0

you don’ know why into the vet with dog often your judgement aren’ necessary vet and are very close and specifically ask for apecific test done ’ also got two cat who the same vet one every two month ,0

financially you should fine but think you should step back and think about whether you really want dog are just going along with this you want dog are you sure this the dog for you the answer both those may yes but just make sure you think about carefully answer your actual question though you probably looking something around 500 year for routine vet care including vaccine and flea tick heartworm medication then maybe another 300 500 for food depending brand you with maybe round 1000 total once you include occasional toy dog bed treat etc the big thing that can add fast are regular doggy daycare boarding dogsitting and training but none those are strictly required you don want and don need ,0
when adopted little chaos child she wa the heavy side she can finish all her food gulp started scattering her kibble throughout the yard make her eat slower originally this wa not intended enrichment activity but she us her nose look for the food and now her favorite thing ,0

felt like you when first got maltese year ago world revolved around him and couldn without him worried about him constantly and when had friend over for visit still tended him and constantly made him the centre attention hard not but eventually died down started out for few hour here and there with husband and while wa hard first because constantly wondered wa got easier yet again going out the evening wa hard because literally thought dog would scared once got dark and didn want him being alone truthfully bit ridiculous thing constantly thinking dog aren afraid the dark silly lol sometimes when and out the house all day long running errand and stuff start feel the guilt but because attached understand how you feel however you need give your dog bit freedom from you because what you don realize much you think spending all this time with your beloved pooch benefitting them you are not teaching them reasonable perception independence don mean leaving your dog all day long day and day out course not but your dog will develop some serious separation issue you constantly home not only that but will affect your personal relationship too dog sleep most the day and evening and that more than likely what your dog will you decide out for few hour with your friend you can course get another canine companion for your dog but then you run the risk feeling exactly the same apart from wondering your dog are getting along when you aren home when the relationship between them still new but totally understand been your shoe and often wondered wa who suffered the separation anxiety and not dog but doing what did dog essentially panic whenever husband leave out the sooner you start get used the fact that give your dog some independence the better will ,0

the taurine test aren’ the problem ’ that don’ believe the situation you’ claiming here also find bit baffling that you swear your food but find necessary test constantly you’ that unsure about your food why keep feeding you’ pretty certain everywhere else that you know what’ causing the taurine deficiency and dcm contrary why research ha shown why the food you’ selected not good enough confident it formula the more hear from you the more thing don’ add ,0
firstly not everyone love dog and that okay whenever dog giving you unwanted attention usually brief acknowledgement see you dog toy thrown the opposite direction just ignoring them will the trick think speaks volume that you taking step try more comfortable with your parent dog from volunteering animal shelter found that the best way greet dog lower yourself somehow find chair and sit particularly boisterous wouldn recommend sitting the floor attempt kiss you and knock you over the process unless already settled jump you stand cross your arm and turn away from him personally don mind when dog jump but this behavior that try not encourage especially since some dog will 100 one day and could knock someone over doing this you can talk him quiet voice jumping and you turned away but eventually settle once settle you award with attention personally sit down again that don tower over the dog then you can offer your hand for found safest offer hand closed fist more difficult for the dog get his mouth around palm facing upward and offer hand that few inch below the dog snout instead coming from above the dog head dog have very sensitive mouth and can distinguish between your hand and toy they won bite down unless aggressive out the many dog worked with only have legitimately tried bite and they had given plentiful warning sign beforehand and most may play nibble lightly grazing their teeth with jaw pressure have yet meet healthy dog who didn love butt scratch almost sure bet that love that once you start petting dog and relaxes you naturally relax little bit well ,0

agree with the other poster about talking your roommate first that said jumping pretty straightforward bad habit fix provided your roomie okay with you tackling this training below post put few week ago response the same question the dog jumping because want attention dog who really excited see someone even negative attention often good enough because still attention when jump instantly stop interacting with him stand tall cross your arm shift your gaze upward and stand still really going nut you can turn around calmly when stop jumping you can uncross your arm and look pet interact with the dog again early encourage you something not terribly exciting when you start give attention again you have big party immediately going too hard resist jumping again immediately stay strong your criterion only give pet and attention when not jumping 100 the time long you stay strong you should start see the jumping behavior extinguish within few day ,0

have pet store near where live and realized the lady who worked there wa certified vet nutritionist what are her credential exactly did she graduate from veterinary school and she certified with the american college veterinary nutrition this point didn’ know that wa true not but told her about the study with grain free food she didn’ know about that and explained her what ha been going and why should change even she doe have all the necessary credential call herself veterinary nutritionist she definitely hasn been staying date current research that alone would make question her recommendation frankly everything else aside would have taken business elsewhere you went the store buy dog food not get lecture what you should shouldn feeding your dog whatever her credential are she sound like very pushy salesperson who bullied you into buying something you didn want she want tell people what feed their dog and ha the appropriate credential then maybe she should actually practice veterinary nutritionist not sale clerk ,0
becoming vet nutritionist would mean she would need vet school which very expensive and grueling process you don get certified you through year schooling and into massive amount debt become dvm mostly skeptical the whole she said vet have training nutrition unlike her and they are bought out and educated big company like purina vet certainly have training nutrition and are required have such knowledge order meet the requirement graduate they like your human that they know enough steer you the right direction but there something beyond their knowledge that when they get specialist involved like nutritionist vet also are not bought out purina you seeing vet that being swayed the subway lunch their representative provides them with once twice month there are bigger problem going here ,0
don’ know she’ listed that directory but she told that she graduated from vet school don’ know she could have been fake ,0

haha true though sorry the “certified vet nutritionist” bad wording part asked she went through vet school and she said yes and that’ how she know they aren’ taught anything about nutrition but honestly the more think about the more ridiculous sound can’ imagine you’ drop all that money vet school and still working pet store but she had business card calling herself vet nutritionist and she seemed really nice like she wouldn’ lie about that kind thing guess doesn’ matter clearly shouldn’ listening this person advice she’ probably fake haha very true ’ applying med school the near future and she wa like “’ the same for doctor they won’ teach you thing about nutrition ” which isn’ true have friend med school who have decent general understanding the topic ,0
can understand the confusion there lot confusion when come dog food all want what best for our dog company with clever people prey that they give little logical idea marketing that buy into because they appeal emotionally and there certain sense them like the grain free thing have never heard fromm belittled comparison orijen that first for most people who recommend orijen also recommend fromm they have always been given equal weighting interesting that she very fromm biased everyone that have spoken about dog nutrition wind saying the same thing you with big brand purina royal canin whatever with the most expensive variant their food smaller boutique brand can great and can not great orijen fine food fromm raw potentially interesting this where the big split happens the vet know have all begun say don raw their reasoning sound they get lot intake dog raw who have picked parasite bacteria and virus they also see the impact incomplete raw diet from their perspective raw risk the flip side that definitely possible feed raw and there may benefit however you were make certain you are feeding nutritionally complete diet anyway would not too swayed your dog store orijen proponent their word sound lot like the regurgitation marketing stuff that suggests that their perspective biased they mentioned vet and making money off dog food then suspect that there some projection going vet make money from dog food yes but mean their most profitable meaningful income stream most vet sell the highest quality whatever brand have available price that usually isn significantly higher often the price the same lower than premium dog food whereas dog store primary income often pet food one food more profitable than another there incentive push think that the grain free thing wa great marketing spin fed puppy fromm puppy gold when shifted away from raw due travel plan and not dietary concern and did great now and still doing great very active dog and ha endless reserve endurance ,0

sound under stimulated and bored the whining could also anxiety and the anxiety could fueled partially the tense discussion between yourself and your father when you say getting exercise you mean walk just him running the yard walk and free time run empty space are two different thing walk provide challenge exploration need travel their local area that dog need daily would encourage more walk and adding structure the walk add basic command into the outtings like asking dog sit stay lay down various place have dog jump playground structure take dog new place give the dog stimulation that more tired home and le likely whine activity home can include obedience training and scavenger hunt well interactive toy like puzzle and kongs ,0

you have never raised dog yourself you cannot perform higher impact exercise you don’ have the money for groomer but you want buy from breeder and you don’ want dog hair everywhere aside from size and maybe trainability what you like about acds would absolutely recommend against herding breed they are typically high energy and imo their often above average intelligence make them harder tire out mentally and more prone creative mischief personally think most herding dog kept casual pet are recipe for neurotic bored dog neurotic the sense that many shepherds—and also terrier who have similar mix energy and intelligence—seem prone obsessive behavior like obsessing over tennis ball tail chasing running circle excessively chewing licking their tail and paw etc also why you want puppy were you would contact behaviorist ideally but the right trainer could invaluable too they’ experienced temperament testing and ask they can work with you rescue adult dog who meet your criterion ’ going just with the puppy from breeder thing and assume that although you not have the money for grooming you have one off pot money for the cost buying purebred puppy from responsible breeder and all the many starting cost associated with puppy vet crate toy food etc ignore the size you’ interested would recommend papillon they are brilliant companion dog not big shedder and although they’ fairly high energy you’ always around toss toy and walk daily don’ think you’ have problem they’ very small dog but seems like you want companion with high potential for training and they are that they are notoriously good watch dog but much like chihuahua don’ see why you couldn’ curb the potential for excessive barking with lot socialization and some training especially you’ home all day can think lot other smart companion dog they’ all smaller than you prefer and most them have high maintenance coat cavalier shih tzus the only dog can think that meet all your preference the adult dog potentially mutt hanging out shelter rescueme com waiting for you it new best friend you might for instance find adult pit pit mix with chilled out disposition whatever really try not underestimate the possibility that there adult dog who already your perfect match—none that raising puppy and hoping you can predict it adult temperament nonsense specifically said pit pit mix because they’ usually around don’ shed too much are typically confident and self possessed and are typically very trainable eager please they’ called “game dogs” because they are “game” whatever you ask them and although the majority pit staffies apbts are high energy many are absolutely not long they’ exercised daily and have lot and lot contact with their owner and especially they have task perform the thing with pit you want laid back one you almost certainly need find adult where you can ass their already developed temperament although actually think you can find everything you’ looking for pit adult really the only way the good news that pit and pit mix are usually abundance ’ not like you’ combing the earth for one who suit your need area you can’ swing chicken any local shelter without hitting super chilled out awesome adult pit pit mix have pretty encyclopedic knowledge dog breed and ’ really struggling think one that meet all your preference first time owner puppy but from breeder professional grooming minimal shedding extra trainable low zero slobber moderate low energy just don’ see happening unless you let the puppy thing and commence hunting for the perfect adult hope someone can respond comment with breed who tick all these box and prof wrong ,0

orijen and fromm are both great food feel though she work for champion the parent company orijen and acana and wa there brand rep she may also have certificate nutrition but the fact she wa dead set that single brand raise big red flag not done enough research into the grain free debacle however dog requires grain free she get hot spot switching her not option being said not opposed high quality grain being small component high quality pet food don know enough about the heart issue debate argue you should feed grain free not but will argue that fromm fantastic food dog eats the star grain free formula and cat would feed gold wa able feed grain cat throw with grained diet it easier just feed them all grain free would not hesitate for second reccomend fromm and really like know what her issue from what recall fromm gold us oatmeal the majority the grain along with barley and quinoa could wrong and they also may use whole grain rice wheat corn and soy that are the biggest issue with digestiion and definitely doe not contain any those x200b suprised she did not reccomend the acana classic which have grain and similar ingredient profile fromm ,0

this going rather long post that hope will you some perspective sorry for the length firstly the woman you spoke almost certainly fraud she truly had the academic background that she implicitly claim she would know that research favor grain free diet for healthy animal best inconclusive perhaps non existent not claim terribly well versed pet nutrition but did spend lot time poring over the research that could find and here mean actual peer reviewed research article not random blogposts aside most unsubstantiated blogposts say nearly verbatim what you quote the woman saying conclusion that above certain nutritional quality all dog food more le equal nutritional quality your conclusion may vary much like with human eating mcdonald’ for every meal objectively bad idea but there are many form healthy balanced diet and most actually pretty mediocre diet well theory the prevalence anecdotal evidence for grain free being better the same for most human fad diet you switch from fast food gluten free diet you are probably improving the quality your diet many more way than cutting out gluten likewise you switch your dog food from bargain bin crap anything remotely balanced you’ likely see some improvement also both case but especially dog food ’ impossible discount the placebo effect created great marketing and branding that being said actually feed our dog grain free boutique brand dog food honestly think ’ better than other option but doe well and feel good about feeding him pay more than probably need but the fact that considers his meal bowl treat worth the other hand the dog family had while wa growing were all fed pedigree and most lived ripe old age with few health issue you should chose food that you feel comfortable feeding your dog that your dog enjoys and doe well and that fit your budget ,0

this what want when look for breeder mostly not totally happy folk who received dog from that breeder before always ask can get contact with people they placed puppy with before the event that this their first litter ask the breeder about their mentor and can contact that person transparency what behavioural health issue have come with previous litter will the breeder provide proof health testing the breeder bred dog that ha some sort issue why the breeder breed outside standard why evidence that their resident dog are happy healthy and stable not super fussed about titling but care about whether new puppy come from dog who make good companion why the breeder particularly distant rural want know how well the dog more urban environment ideally like see breeder something with their dog that take them off property and expose them the world commitment taking any dog bred back whether home placed well commitment keeping with how the dog they bred are doing usually start search after met dog from breeder line that like sometimes this agility trial sometimes training class sometimes just through random happenstance after coming upon youtube video then much online research can there little seen online try find associated breeder track pedigree see what the dog have been ,0

did posted here curious anyone else ha encountered this ha any thought have all kind discussion here about dealing with rescue this different except when having surrender trying adopt ,0
how are you connecting with people who own rotties just the dog park something are they your friend always hard tell the people who you see out and about actually invested looking for good breeder they just picked the first google search shade those people just know some people don necessarily care much thanks for the advice will definitely check out some local breed club and look see there are any dog show near area that pretty good for husky weather wise imagine that the interest pretty high since you can stuff like sledding skijoring here really appreciate the comment super helpful ,0

this great list thing consider thank you quick question what are some good resource help educate myself how determine dog ha all the important requisite health testing ,0
don think you should ask both dog were off leash your dog had been leash you would have had more control over the situation but also leg stand legally doubt the area marked off leash area the city but with both dog being off leash one dog being off leash there isn really more wrong right than the other one your defense the dog owner wasn present however sound though your attention wasn fully the dog either you aren sure which one started the altercation while suck that your dog wa attacked there were step that could have been taken prevent the area shared area you said both dog may feel territorial about the land and act accordingly the dog may have reacted differently neutral ground also feel that would have been most fair talk the owner the time the event the owner may not realize how badly your dog wa injured and when you slap them with bill later they may accuse you making the whole thing without video proof there solid evidence about which two dog had unpleasant interaction and resulted the bite injury the owner could refuse pay take you court and you have way prove who did but again legal leg stand both dog were off leash shared area x200b sorry sound like jerk had fair share unpleasant experience with other dog interacting with dog live apartment with shared yard and never let dog out without and her leash exercise her off property and generally away from other dog because just don fully trust her not react another dog not react x200b x200b x200b x200b ,0
thank you much for the link going peruse that website very closely would weird for show club event don have husky myself like grown adult playground with kid lol ,0
work this field and generally responsible for the face face interaction with those who surrender their pet shelter although this isn’ something ever and sound seems more extreme than have ever seen some the reasoning behind generally speaking after the surrender don’ and shouldn’ care about the previous owner course this sound harsh and genuinely sympathize with many owner and understand and agree with their reasoning for surrender but the bottom line ’ now our job find someone else deal with the problem that the previous owner could not and top priority all about finding that next and hopefully permanent owner this hard when you keep mind that the last owner really did everything they could how are supposed find someone willing even more for pet they haven’ bonded with social medium usually the only way for rescue advertise free and easily spread with any social medium see this always turn viscous people will argue and trash talk anything however assuming that the previous owner’ information stay complete anonymous true with any shelter have worked with ’ actually included our relinquishment contract that will not disclose info between the previous and new owner unless both agree which usually they not another reason dramatize sympathy for funding funding permanent issue for any non profit and those who surrender donate enough cover even one day shelter care most money donated shelter are those who never need use single function the shelter believe not again seems this rescue being much more extreme than the norm and not saying their tactic are something agree with but hopefully this shed some light the reality the other side the rescue and maybe provides some solace the previous owner ,0
that’ awesome husband ha treeing walker plott hound mix brindle coloring with white blaze his chest bay’ beautifully long lean and strong like shark run like the wind ,0
could try but ’ usually short period time because pick her and say “ ” firm relatively loud voice she doe usually stop think some degree over excitement but what ha confused something which happened earlier after playing with her for around hour she wa tired she usually wa she wa sitting the couch with calmly snuggled and slightly chewing the lace from hoodie bent over grab phone the table which then brought face quite close hers she then jump and try’ bite nose and then ear ’ not sure that’ aggression just the fact she doesn’ come into physical contact with human face much yet ,0
used volunteer for some rescue area two the three were run total nutcase think the tear jerker story are due wanting appeal the emotion potential adopter and those rescue are often blinded the cause which good one animal rescue they can’ empathize with the human the other end yes many people are careless and give too easily but many others are good people who are stuck between rock and hard place and ultimately have choose rehome their beloved pet ’ been that end needing rehome rescue dog who wa aggressive toward child sank thousand into trainer medicine tool etc only reach the conclusion that our kid would not safe with her the home and she needed different environment wa bullied and shamed the rescue wa volunteering with the time ’ awful they suck ,0
really hard tell out and someone ha rottie and for conversation ask about then can look later know about where they got and good can just move don like usually just walk people also feel like that bit harassy like somebody sitting nearby something just strike convo there also event hosted breed club you can ,0
sometimes when dog traumatically injured they can injure themselves after treatment not anyone fault just happens and not anyone fault sound like you have everyone best interest heart ,0
that would good info include your post did they respond ,0
sure ’ start keeping some record note phone wa reading some stuff online too would teaching some sort leave command beneficial but what wa worrying she got excited and started biting someone’ hand express her excitement and said leave would that prevent her from expressing herself and wind causing bigger “tantrum” ,0
sound like you tried everything you know this point you should probably find behaviorist who good they work with you and most likely put you good plan how treat the most efficient way better sooner than latter while the dog still young ,0
you’ already gotten great suggestion ’ just add that like play tug will sit for ball you can set your phone second timer and then get photo burst case some are blurred ’ taken many great selfie while playing tug during pause tugging and picture jrt sitting for ball sound adorable ,0
guess that the description the posting targeted potential adopter not your friend and that misguided attempt sob story marketing for the comments—well commenting many forum not much this one fortunately self selects for stupid and bashing seems hobby for many people experience with rescue people ha been limited cat but been many cat there are some very competent sane people working that arena but there are also people who are batshit crazy and borderline misanthropic sorry this happened your friend unfortunately there probably not much that can done about ,0

this another reason why people end situation that have gone way too far there too much potential shame admitting you over your head personally would have opted euthanize this dog this situation people might think cruel for that well long they are euthanizing million perfectly healthy cat and dog doesn make lot sense throw huge resource after one dog whose multiple problem make him her potentially dangerous finding him another home unlikely remove the danger the stress and misery this expectant mother going through now wa 100 inflicted upon her the fallacy sunk cost expect the dog even more miserable and confused and the shelter people who thought person reputation not important racking another feel good story that isn really feel good all ,0

thank you for your thoughtful response you have made alot good point think may have been wishful thinking about being able keep with acd other herding class the reason like the idea acd because coat temperament size and train ability not against adopting from shelter going look into that more the reason initially thought breeder because bad experience when adopting the family dog young child the dog ended keeping got puppy now that think think high energy may have been the issue with the first thankfully the first were placed with better match after and afaik they lived happy life ,0
you said you genuinely curious see how would approach this wouldn say that owning bully breed dog requires special accommodation any kind this where and several dog neutral organization and even pro pit disagree besides being known escape artist pit bull are one only handful dog where the official recommendation for their care includes having breakstick with you all time honestly puzzled why you would think that dog with innate highly dog aggression would not require any sort special accommodation the reality high mean minimum that significantly more effort need into socializing the animal and also may mean that your dog will just never good fit dog park require kenneling doggy daycare that can accommodate some level isolation from other animal this isn trying dick towards pit bull these are just the fact about owning any breed with built high dog aggression fact that even pro pit organization often agree with x200b the truth pit bull were bred for fighting and they can still aggressive breed—especially toward other unknown dog even your pit bull well taken care friendly and well socialized…’ possible can still snap ’ most liable happen when your dog between and year old and state excitement—like when ’ roughhousing with other dogs… there are thing you can help prevent your dog from getting fight get your dog obedience class train how resist the urge fight socialize your dog place where the dog are leashed like pet store invest break stick that fight break out you can stop quickly finally and most importantly all put your dog position succeed and that mean not taking your pit bull dog park where will around other unleashed dog \ from bullymax site geared towards health and care bully breed can link more but the above fairly representative the advice given pit owner good nature x200b but would certainly say that owning intact dog any breed that older than eighteen month should require special breeding license that can only obtained through documented interaction and partnership with the kennel club that way stop shitty pit bull breeder from churning out puppy and selling them out guard dog and also shut down all the puppy mill agree one hundred percent x200b and again you said that pit bull bite tend kill while other dog bite don but going back your case study the kentucky office saw that the fatality involved pit bull you picking just one study have many many more that aggregate paint very clear picture when pit bull attack the attack tend last longer and average result greater injury higher medical cost and higher incidence surgery than compared other breed you can say that the bad owner but that just sidestep the issue the reality damage inflicted x200b suppose that dog need sixty pound bigger order kill someone isn possible that pit bull represent all dog bigger than sixty pound that case all fatality are coming from pit bull because all big dog are pit bull again you were tally the data across multiple study that figure more like but even were take the value keep mind that labrador retriever are one not the most popular breed north america lab are fairly big dog are you suggesting there are more pit bull than lab feel like you grasping straw here ,0

you are very welcome and hope help behaviorist quality trainer really can help match you with great dog know someone who hired trainer train her own service dog and the trainer worked with her pretty exhaustively find the perfect fit even the first match wound not working out and they were able return the dog and then resume the search and then found the perfect dog shelter are far more likely forgiving with hit and miss like that than breeder will although some breeder are great about this and will take back puppy dog even year later should something happen but think that’ exceptional also shelter rescue might have someone staff who doe temperament testing and who can work with you find fit even better many shelter rescue are willing let you foster dog before you commit adoption when get dog have three week “trial” period thing aren’ going work after three week have rehoming return plan three week just personal preference because feel ’ long enough make decision but short enough that ’ not hopelessly attached and neither the dog two out the three dog got were bought off individual one wa part accidental litter and the other wa bought rescue him from being bought dog fighter who wa about buy him and between their actual going rate and their vet bill top the regular cost associated with puppy took the three week trial knowing didn’ work out would big financial loss the other dog wa what called the “clearance puppy ” got her from rescue for 150 and she wa spayed microchipped and had all her shot plus got voucher purchase collar leash and toy and voucher for free vet visit any the local participating veterinary practice could choose from several didn’ work out could have just brought her back the rescue also she’ ever lost and the microchip company contacted and they cannot reach for any reason the company will contact the rescue and they will hold onto her until can reunited what ’ saying shelter and rescue are often amazing and cost efficient she wa also year old when got her and she’ quite simply the best dog ever she had some serious fear anxiety behavioral issue when got her but could just tell she would perfect once she felt secure and wa absolutely right think lot people don’ really know what they’ looking when they’ rescuing dog for instance the super friendly dog who wagging it tail and jumping all over the place when you meet may say “friendly and playful” potential adopter whereas the dog may actually too high energy and have sense personal space knocking thing over etc rescue literally had zero interest meeting she wa shy and withdrawn but she wasn’ scared silly either knew once bonded and she felt secure with she wa going nice and mellow and she extremely laid back quiet and friendly but not overly interested people college friend called her catdog because she sleep lot and often wait for people come over and pet her instead running people for attention knew wanted low energy small dog who would happy apartment and good with guest and got her thought thought wanted dachshund but she’ beagle basset later learned can’ stand most dachshund ,0

think ’ bit alarming that your older dog reacting that badly puppy who still had “puppy pas ” dog can tell when puppy hasn’ gone through it first hormonal change and that phase referred puppy pas because typically older dog will more tolerant towards young puppies’ bad behavior also find alarming that your older dog giving clear warning but the situation being allowed escalate the point biting ’ your responsibility ensure that this never happens ’ bad situation for both the dog even serious harm coming the puppy you would never let this occur the older dog wa rottweiler shouldn’ happening with chihuahua mix either the chi mix learning that the puppy ha decency and the puppy learning the chi mix aggressive what happens when the border collie adolescent testing boundary hears the growl and decides strike first there are many way socialize two dog household without risking this behavior you could get buddy and walk the dog together with you and your partner between the dog and the leash short enough that the dog cannot interact with one another with one person walking few pace behind the other you can place their crate next each other with some space between each feel secure and training drill with them with treat you can even just have them crated opposite side the same room your older dog still crated when you’ out and about the point set them for success and never give opportunity for them get into these bad situation where there discomfort and aggression beagle mix used correct pit mix when wa puppy and doing something naughty but wasn’ aggressive looked like parenting wa her pup but ’ chi wa like your chi and took probably full year them bonding before would leave them alone the same room together knowing that nothing would happen between them chihuahua are known “clannish ” meaning they’ known for not getting along with other breed and tend not fond stranger dog and otherwise know this isn’ true all chihuahua but this definitely known breed tendency ’ not sure that high energy medium sized breed puppy wa great choice companion for aging chihuahua appreciate your good intention but you are looking for dog keep your chi mix company might better idea look for mature dog that you can some meeting with beforehand where the dog able meet it potential companion and interact few time see ’ good match your dog might learn tolerate the border collie but think ’ unlikely that this pairing going have the outcome you were looking for you want your dog have friend think you should rethink your decision get puppy whose personality will likely always abrasive your dog know that’ probably not what you want hear but honestly don’ think this puppy going increase your dog’ quality life your heart set puppy consider mellow breed like pug chihuahua usually sleep hour day like cat they also tend live quite long time year your decision going impact it “golden years” for hopefully long time your collie fully adult year old that mean your chi mix going when the collie begin slow down and border collie well even maturity they are extremely active dog with insane amount stamen since they’ bred manage flock literally all day long add that what happens your chi mix want run around and met dog trying herd running circle around and nipping maybe try giving this read really want border collie html ,0

doe know how play tug with rule like letting when you say and going back after when you say fetch ’ not sure what impulse control game you’ using but got pit mix when wa four month old and had absolutely training and wa the mouthiest puppy ’ ever met make matter worse almost none the normal way curbing his mouthing like yelping had any effect whatsoever thing got extreme the solution wa two part and might help you with the “mean” biting redirection behavior the first thing wa that realized the only thing dog responded wa not getting attention the moment his mouth touched would become instantly stoic and soundlessly and robotically leave the room would count and then enter the room cheerfully and begin play with tug toy repeat repeat repeat probably walked out the room 20x minute but actually caught very quickly once adopted this method the second part wa teaching him play tug say “get ” for him latch and “enough” say stop didn’ let would hold onto the toy but like rag doll with zero resistance very boring for him and calmly repeat the command the very instant let would become animated again and say “get ” other word when responded “enough ” the game would immediately resume with much fun and enthusiasm could pump into after understood those two command and that putting his mouth resulted being abandoned any time thought wa danger mouthing getting hyped charging towards etc would immediately lift hand under arrest and say “get ” and would run and get his toy and would commence playing tug and fetch bonus once the dog understands those two command they also understand fetch dog almost four year old and this day when feel himself getting overly excited will run and find rope toy which sort hilarious ’ revved over guarding house from suspicious stranger and then run get his toy when the threat ha passed cannot overstate how useful have dog instinctively engage appropriate behavior getting rope toy when the dog know ’ getting over excited literally taught him healthy acceptable way cope with his feeling and ha stuck hope this help puppy naturally know two game when they’ born tug and chase you just need build the natural game tug also whenever licked hand would say “that’ what you with hand ” happily within few week the above training combined with this phrase looked like wa about mouth while wa relatively calm could say “what you with hand ” and would give hand docile lick ,0

rabies kill about 000 people every year how are you confidant that wa not exposed rabid dog ,0
poor little baby ☹ ,0
that odd spot extra smelly unfortunately out idea try getting second opinion maybe another vet will see something the other one missed hope you figure out what wrong ,0
that too but always worry little that the second hand stuff could infected with something contagious and dog would catch don know how possible this ,0
have the same experience daily basis with shelter mut people come and ask what kind dog always respond dont know he shelter dog and they are shoked that such cute dog can come from shelter the shelter area are filled the brim with pit mix it sad ,0
thanks ’ probably going get second opinion this next week ,0
you should inform life incorrectness ,0
wa just the anal gland you would know that smell distinct that there would question about think you got trust your gut and push the vet more this since you know something clearly wrong could skin infection something maybe know harder with small dog but like another person suggested try pinpoint where exactly the smell coming from ,0
they can real stickler about pre existing condition also they will meticulously through vet record your vet ever made note something the dog file they will find have insurance for dog and think good investment but would research and ask them front about their policy before committing ,0
bully nice possibly some american bulldog ,0
bully and some jack russel type terrier something make want say beagle too maybe ,0

’ sorry didn’ make you tried help him and for that thank you you have good heart ,0
scaly stomach definitely odd and could larger skin problem overall doe his stomach seem any different you friend had rescue dog with scaly skin her stomach and elbow that turned out severe food allergy and thyroid issue that previous vet detected this could longstanding issue that just finally displaying itself more obvious way try take note anything that seems even slightly off about your dog both physical and behavioral give the vet much information possible help them figure out what wrong with your guy his age there also may abnormality that you just been kind ignoring because they been that way for long try think those thing well also just want say good you for knowing your pup and pushing this make sure okay lucky have you ,0

thanks for pulling all these link together great resource point people new the topic still unclear what the place taurine all this both freeman november tuft update and the december javma article mention that there seem two distinctly different group dog with diet associated dcm smaller group which the dcm accompanied low whole blood plasma taurine level and larger group which blood plasma taurine normal even elevated the javma article particular seems further suggest that the underlying cause must therefore different between these two group but the two study just published despite sharing some author with the javma piece seemed more cautious what can concluded from the blood taurine level dog with diet associated dcm from the golden retriever study which all dog the clinical group had both dcm and low taurine there little understanding how plasma and whole blood taurine concentration correlate with myocardial taurine concentration the dog endomyocardial biopsy challenging and not clinically practical confound the assessment taurine concentration even further the degree which breed size specific reference range are necessary unknown but supported data that establish specific breed like golden retriever newfoundland and american cocker spaniel having greater risk for taurine deficiency and subsequent cardiac disease and from the ncsu echocardiographic study which contrast none the out dcm dog who received blood plasma taurine test showed deficient level noted that several dog eating diet had very high whole blood taurine concentration these dog were not supplemented before the diagnosis dcm therefore these value are unexpected light study taurine concentration normal dog and dog with dcm elevated whole blood taurine ha been reported people after myocardial infarction because taurine rapidly taken platelet after myocardial release into the bloodstream with cardiomyocyte injury and death the high value noted some dog may have been related myocardial injury the ncsu study which included breed and several mutt doesn name which diet the dog were eating the way the golden study doe kinda disappointing because leaf the reader unclear whether for example the non diet that out the dcm dog were eating might still have contained legume tuber uncommon meat etc ,0

yeah the issue that article raise are very legit and familiar and course agree that shelter and rescue organization should improve the way they handle adoption the issue there resource you away with rigid rule and checklist you need better funding and staff handle placement and follow more complicated nuanced way for —something like the “fenced yard” requirement doe the face seem utterly stupid but there’ crude kind logic too many place serf imperfect proxy for income and stability life stage fenced yard also mean that dog that’ never walked likely have decent regular opportunity pee and poop—that one minimum standard basic welfare met ruling out adopter who live apartment complex the fenced yard requirement also probably reduces some extent the chance that dog will returned the shelter rescue system for problem behavior that enrage near neighbor such barking indoors and picking fight with other dog common area just preemptively ’ not saying the “fenced yard” rule great obviously ’ not the purebred breeder end thing think one big question everybody’ not asking about whether purebred dog should produced “responsibly” for the pet companion market ,0

that link isn working hoping this temporary behavior because her tempermant the shelter wa entirely different honestly probably not shelter environment are extremely stressful and tend shut dog down dog will act very quiet and mild shelter and then will complete 180 and become outgoing reactive even aggressive when moved into private home sound like you dealing with few separate issue cat aggression reactivity and your dog not liking not being used being handled hence the growl nip just being really clear this sound like project dog that not very good for your household mostly because worry for the safety your cat dog who are good with cat aren exactly easy find shelter environment the \ easiest\ and \ safest\ thing would return this dog the shelter she can placed home without cat and moving forward for your situation would best find dog who currently foster home and who living peacefully with cat foster home unlike shelter will allow dog reveal their true personality dog foster home much more predictable animal than dog shelter you really want give try with this dog myself and others can try help you come with some management and training reduce the reactivity and prey drive but going long road and working with reactive dog very frustrating and time consuming x200b ,0
not use heating pad electric blanket made for human your dog dog have higher body temperature than human even the lowest setting might too warm for them heated dog bed operate low voltage they are safe for canine don know where you looking but all the online pet store and amazon all have heated dog bed and pad think the one bought year ago just picked from petsmart and worked great you want name manufacturing make wide range product from large heated bed heating pad and they good quality given your dog age suggest orthopedic bed possibly something raised she ha difficulty getting off the floor given her size ,0
very reasonable question our previous dog wa perfect for our lifestyle but wa not good with child when passed were hoping get dog that would extremely gentle and tolerate kid also wanted something protect the house and more superficial level husband prefers large dog and prefer dog with long coat seemed like the great pyrenees fit within all those category ’ mean new dog ownership and have both grown with dog but don’ think wa prepared solely for how stubborn pyrs are the first few night she did really well and slept laid quietly our room for the whole night but last night she needed poop and that’ when she decided wa play time she would not come for anything understand that she probably doesn’ see authoritarian yet but she doe obey sometimes the time she doesn’ listen are particularly frustrating posted here yesterday the day before about some idea for “jobs” for her mostly came with her “guarding” looking for our son and watching over the house but those thing will require her build relationship with our family and for her feel “ home” have little time play ball with her outside and take her for walk plus our kid grow they’ able run around with her but maybe that’ not enough seems like wasn’ then nobody would able keep pyrs indoor dog overall guess could have been really dumb decision just don’ want disappoint husband her former foster and her there’ any hope for eventually accept the difficult part her personality ,0

puppy lot work you doing potty training obedience training dealing with destructive chewing basically think all the downside having baby they adorable but they can also very frustrating you may also not able leave them alone for very long young puppy can hour without using the bathroom and very young puppy may have you getting several time night take them out potty the advantage that you raising the dog yourself and have le concern about getting dog that already poorly socialized ha learned wide variety bad behavior plus course the adorable part adult dog especially over about likely over the destructive chewing and can usually the entire workday without being let outside you getting rescue there good chance they already housebroken and may already have some basic obedience and you get one that been fostered you have pretty good idea the behavior that you can expect with adult that retiring from show specifically you likely pay more but would have the advantage dog you know both healthy and well trained ,0

you wouldn necessarily have return her the high kill shelter you got her from now the two biggest concern are the safety your cat and your safety due your neuro issue she reactive through your gate odds are that she going reactive leash well which mean that she will likely pull hard and lunge trigger not good safe situation for you since you only had her for few day suggestion this through two week shutdown week shutdown html with her will give her time get used your environment and you and perhaps she will settle slightly once she figured out the routine and that she safe space the one modification make for the shutdown leash time inside don think the dog need leashed constantly while indoors with you everything else accurate though and for this dog would add that you shouldn harnessing her right now harness object that need conditioned and order properly condition object the dog need trust you first this dog not used handled the handling involved harnessing her pushing her past her comfort point keep her flat collar and exercise her the yard just give her time settle hard training session nothing when she laying calmly and relaxing toss her treat she glance one the cat without growling barking throw her treat reward her passively for being calm dog your home don ask too much her just let her relax into her new home then after two week ass her progress see how she deal with the cat see how she behaving general around the trigger you noticing she ha car loud noise etc and then decide what her progress look like come back here and tell what her progress can help her behavior day after going through shut down going much easier judge than her behavior now mere ten hour after being removed from stressful shelter ,0

since when wa getting dog something that had become job interview why earth should people have feel like they are trial because they want companion animal why rescue and breeder feel like they should the gatekeeper the world pet ownership the united state ha huge pet retention problem imperative that breeder and rescue their part make sure prospective owner ready for the commitment dog particularly the person want certain breed dog that ha above average need high energy dog dog who are busy body and need activity grooming requirement etc absolutely disagree that response mean someone didn impress rescue breeder unless you literally wrote how much sell dog lack reply probably due oversight read email while stopped for train and there are plenty time where long forgotten about that email when finally sit down the computer breeder and rescue have different comfort level what acceptable for one might hard for another that can force breeder rescue who require fenced yard because dog who had yard wa given off leash access bolted and got hit car drop their standard maybe screw over good home but also safe guard against someone who decides let their dog off leash have bit freedom and put the dog risk tough situation and suck for good home get denied but breeder rescue have live with their choice and finding out that one their dog got hurt killed even returned because they dropped their standard they have right feel comfortable with their placement decision people who want dog are going get dog can lament all want about how messed the dog world because many unwanted animal wind shelter and how many people who shouldn own dog but closing our door the great unworthy one are effectively perpetuating the cycle both pushing those people le reputable source and taking away access some resource that would actually help them become better dog owner see disagree people who shouldn own dog but get dog anyway aren going take advantage resource that come from reputable breeder someone selfish that their want outweigh logic they aren going saved having reputable breeder their corner you can expect breeder help people who can arsed have any level patience commitment well bred puppy from health tested parent important you you aren going jump ship and shitty breeder someone really want responsibly bred bichon they not going walk into pet store and come out with chiweenie and they they already demonstrated they aren willing listen the copious resource available buying dog why the hell would they bother listening the breeder ,0

small dog are typically more aggressive because more thing are threatening them that paired with people physically manipulating them where they wouldn’ with larger dog tends lead situation like that don’ think ’ pain but making very clear that ’ feeling uncomfortable and basically just “back off and leave alone ” his owner make habit ignoring his attempt communicate with them likely given how quick and extreme his reaction ’ shocked they haven’ ever been bitten him but that’ also issue small dog bite can passed off nip they don’ draw blood but all dog bite should taken seriously excluding accidental hard bite during rough play and dog with psychological problem illness that make them jumpy all dog bite are caused dog being pushed the limit their comfort zone and having their body language ignored the more often that boundary pushed the le effective that body language will seem the time between general indicator discomfort yawning lip licking turning away panting ear going back etc giving clearer warning like growling and finally resorting biting will lessen and lessen essentially body language fails growling will more appealing and that doesn’ work but biting doe biting will soon become the first reaction went bit off piste there but yeah bubz clearly pretty used having his body language ignored ,0
agreed can maybe count one hand how many breeder know who are super picky and judgmental the vast majority give their recommendation but ultimately accept that this the owner dog they care more about finding owner with common sense willingness learn adapt and who will love and spoil the dog for life ,0

yes didn think you really had firm grip your correlation causality argument sound good though doesn you stated “going the abandonment and surrender rate pretty clear most people find pit bull enormously difficult raise ” you are implying that the number dog surrendered proof that they are enormously difficult dog that’ different than claiming that difficultly contributes abandonment and surrender which don’ disagrees with but ’ not what you said point wa that the number and type dog surrendered far more greatly influenced other factor claiming that the fact that every single shelter and rescue the now life perpetual fire sale pit bull suggests that they are difficult breed raise not simply their number the rate surrender and the rate compared the rate for every other breed and type including those infamous for being difficult unprecedented have single type dog overwhelmingly rejected their owner those who are most drawn them constant daily basis for well over decade now the reason why see many pit shelter complicated relating thing like spay neuter rate irresponsible breeding popularity and perception and even the poverty rate certain area and yeah the amount effort take own one all factor which effect other breed and type equally with pit bull combine that with the fact that pit statistically have higher length stay shelter and you begin understand the big picture bit better and why there are many them and the reason they have higher length stay what bigotry maybe the reason that many pit bull fancier seek out puppy vain hope that you raise right they won display the problem behavior all familiar with from such news story dog kill child and family fight keep puppy alive after mauling difficult breed not create irresponsible owner difficult breed suffer the hand irresponsible owner these people are much le likely their research and choose breed that suitable for their lifestyle they are much le likely put the time money and effort train and socialize the dog they are le likely spay neuter while not properly managing unaltered dog more likely byb le likely give the dog the physical and mental exercise need difficult breed absolutely create irresponsible owner course some people are going irresponsible and doesn matter their breed but lot well meaning people fail into being irresponsible owner because they acquire dog whose need far beyond their ability this didn start with the pit bull and the reason why people used told find suitable breed unlike now when they told save unwanted pittie this happens with pit bull daily because they free and easy acquire world where dog are now rare and expensive they end with cash strapped owner who can afford the secure fence keep them off the neighbor dog and pit bull are just high maintenance athletic and agile and prone predatory aggressive behavior which are nearly impossible control powerful animal the puppy mill are turning out dog that are wanted least initially people pay lot money for these dog and are more likely try hang them unlike the accidental litter from joe schmoe down the street who give away the puppy for free dump them off shelter best case additionally shelter intake number are not even close pit you exaggeratedly claim take look the new day listing petfinder for big city you’ see that the puppy mill breed are very much represented many the surrendered but more highly desirable dog never even make adoption listing before being pulled adopted out addition bully breed statistically take longer adopt out they stay the shelter while the puppy and other breed quickly pas through pit bull are bred the same way puppy mill dog intentionally and for money they are not oopsy litter between neighbor they more saleable puppy the difference come when they month young dog that point the majority dog owner now are keeping their pet the majority pit bull owner are discarding theirs can fathom why you arguing over the pit bull number sure slight exaggeration not pit fancier personally like shaggy herding breed even pit were all that their advocate claim they wouldn type but ever walked into shelter and saw shaggy herding type looking back through the wire knee pain and then get and anything change that wouldn pissing about you exaggeratedly claiming instead liar anything over roughly insane pit bull simply are not numerous enough that the number see rescue are representative their population shocking shocking disproportion and dodging the issue with pouting about critic having anti pit agenda that perpetuates the hell those animal live and die each day don exaggerate the situation the pit bull you minimizing aware your anti pit agenda and tendency exaggerate when come the subject them and frankly ’ just bad the “pibbles can wrong” stance the people the other side the spectrum ,0

study microbiology and antimicrobial resistance unless there wa suddenly very strong evidence that feeding cooked meat kibble dog wa massively improving their quality life never feed dog raw meat raw meat harbour bacteria some which could have antimicrobial resistance and which could end your dog gut flora and potentially harmful them this also pose health risk owner through close contact with the dog over life time feeding farmed raw meat nothing like wolf killing prey the wild farm animal are treated throughout their life with antibiotic they are also close proximity with other animal and sometimes have poor welfare standard leading many suffering from infectious disease the slaughter process allows faeces the animal and potentially many other animal contaminate the meat wild animal there le infectious disease exposure antibiotic and then when the animal killed and consumed the gut content are not mixed with the meat the wolf consumes think the next few year will see some more concrete research into the risk raw feeding dog and human know some colleague are already researching the transmission antimicrobial bacteria between raw fed dog and human hopefully link found awareness the issue will raised and well help people make more informed choice about raw feeding ,0

think really sad that conformation breeder get the worst rap the dog world every conformation breeder know which dozen save two are incredibly kind thoughtful helpful down earth people who bend over backwards for their dog and puppy buyer vast majority them have hand rescue and help rehome other breeder dog when the need arises mean they just genuinely good people and they barely make profit while spending thousand hour their life devoted breeding dog that are healthy and make other people happy ,0
thought the referenced comment wa much more gatekeepy context given that the had described the good question about health testing and the effort wa putting into outreach breeder wa clear email weren just how much are the puppy which fair question but insufficient inquiry guess great that those breeder can maintain high demand from their current contact and ignore inquiry disconnect phone and abandon their website but that also seems like great way push potential owner away from the part the dog community that value responsible dog ownership and out their own make all the mistake that cause the horror story people talk about dismissing berating people when they are looking for dog will tend make them dismiss your opinion and move someone taking the wrong approach getting puppy and sends the wrong signal denying them doesn save dog from them just mean they find someone who doesn care sell them one may not breeder responsibility talk those people but acting like ignoring them virtue leaf out the bigger picture ,0

completely agree about the risk infection interesting that some vet are now charging more for raw fed dog study antimicrobial resistance and microbiology vet school have some colleague who are currently looking the link between dog antimicrobial resistance human antimicrobial resistance there huge risk that raw feeding can lead your dog harbouring antimicrobial resistant bacteria their gut which can pose massive health problem they don need sick right away the resistant bacteria could just become part their natural flora however when you then treat with antibiotic perhaps for unrelated skin infection you select for those resistant bacteria you mentioned this also pose big health risk human who will similarly harbour the antimicrobial resistant bacteria antimicrobial resistant infection are huge growing problem and have the potential life threatening especially the young old and immunocompromised there around 000 death per year the from sepsis blood stream infection not dog owner the moment but never consider feeding raw meat future dog and plan screen breeder the basis that they don raw feed ,0

okay maybe you are unlucky and your dog eats kibble which contain bacteria one two time it life but with raw feeding your dog will getting small dose bacteria every day with it food it likely that there won enough single meal colonise them and make them sick but they are getting every day and everyday that adding the cocktail bacteria the gut and everyday the dog interacting with you and potentially transmitting you potentially without you getting sick also alongside this you have antimicrobial resistance not every bacteria will resistant but some will and those will also added this cocktail the gut the chance from dos lifetime from kibble compared the bacteria the dog getting everyday from raw feeding minuscule kibble fed dog are shedding pathogen but there pathogen which are normal for dog flora there not pathogen from industrialised farm where many the animal receive antibiotic treatment and there poor hygiene and yes dog eat shit but that normal dog flora they are eating which actually probably doesn have massive effect them because they have that their gut too you find that level quarantining ridiculous then why don you eat raw meat yourself ,0

that question actually get asked quite frequently but outside the adopt don shop crowd there really aren lot people who would answer meant the question everybody not asking here this thread but anyway disagree with you cordially breeding explicitly for the pet companion market very much frowned upon some purebred dog people circle not just the adopt don shop crowd that’ why “does the breeder title their dog ” common item “reputable” “responsible” breeder checklist the party line there with which don’ necessarily disagree that dog should bred excel something—conformation competitive sport such agility ipo hunting working service etc this doesn necessarily apply toy companion breed about which know next nothing ,0

might have misunderstood the question too agree that one the standard responsible breeding that dog meant for breeding must proven some third party good representative the breed whether through conformation showing other competition doe breeder title their dog absolutely part the responsible breeder checklist what think you are saying that this also mean that breeder should only breeding dog for some purpose other than provide companion animal adoptive family seen other thread this the question what breeder purpose for breeding the common phrase improvement the breed etc disagree with this idea honest for one thing even breeder breeding improve the breed working dog show dog are going wind with maybe one two pup from litter that are actually improvement the breed they will keep these continue their program and will adopt out the rest pet that sense they are already breeding for the purpose creating companion animal because that the only thing most their dog become don really see this much different from breeder who doe everything else responsible breeder doe but for the specific purpose producing dog that are great pet when the end result breeding mostly produce pet anyway don see any problem with your stated goal breeding being produce the best pet possible think the difference opinion come from what believe the ultimate purpose titling breeding animal the first place you believe that the only purpose for breeding dog improve some aspect the breed make better show dog better agility dog better working dog then make sense that breeding for the purpose producing pet doesn fit this goal opinion however that the purpose titling breeding parent simply increase the chance that adoptive family looking for particular breed dog actually get the dog that they expect this exactly the reason why went with the bmd breeder that did wanted bmd for all those quintessential thing that make bmd not the least which wa very low energy easy train and hard screw because this wa first dog with fully titled dam and working line sire the chance that puppy would have trait outside what would expected bmd were very low got exactly what bargained for when one the major reason for dog wind shelter that they don fit owner lifestyle this very underrated thing ,0

there really difference though the word adopt simply implies that you are taking responsibility for life that you are adding your household and you are making lifetime commitment that animal whether breeder shelter adopt buy implies the very same exchange money for pet unless you getting your dog for free which quite different and rarely happens shelter anymore with the very same commitment that pet mean already hear constantly from people who bought their dog from shelter talking about how they rescued their dog now you want further cheapen the lifetime commitment that someone who get dog from breeder make insisting that they don use the word adopt there nothing gloss over because the perceived difference only exists the mind people who think that there moral difference between buying shelter dog buying dog from reputable breeder ,0

there really difference though except that difference which contend doe exist the very heart the whole adopt don shop thing have problem stating purchase dog not adopt them buy them there big difference there the word adopt simply implies that you are taking responsibility for life that you are adding your household and you are making lifetime commitment that animal would that that wa true wa would not have people screaming about how the only good people are the one who adopt don shop and that people like are literally causing million dog die every year because insist buying dog don try hide the fact that buy dog fine with that and explain why but will not pretend that adopted dog and that can thus stick thing car that say adopt don shop very much did shop and did research and did buy dog mean already hear constantly from people who bought their dog from shelter talking about how they rescued their dog now you want further cheapen the lifetime commitment that someone who get dog from breeder make insisting that they don use the word adopt not sure where you going with that have met people who bought dog from pet store who claim they rescued the dog they obviously did not but don see how stating that someone bought dog from breeder cheapens their lifetime commitment where ever their dog came from they love the dog and care for the dog how doe anything here cheapen their commitment word are important the adopt don shop movement hadn taken off wouldn gaf but did and don say adopted dog state right out bought them there nothing gloss over because the perceived difference only exists the mind people you say you think the breeder your puppy from think you adopted the dog from her guessing that you wrote check and that you bought the dog and that you told hard core adopt don shop person that you did this they not happy all look you want say you somehow magically adopted very well bred bernese mountain dog for but you bought the dog from breeder process that some circle very much vilified you wind spending time purebred dog circle you will meet people like who will tell you you bought the dog fine great but don try pretend that you adopted the dog ,0

brace yourself for novel been your shoe know you looking for way convince your parent that you should have dog made multiple powerpoint presentation titled why need dog they still didn get dog and sure you done lot reading what having dog entail waited get dog and volunteered animal shelter the interim never thought say this but glad that waited love dog more than anything the world but there are certain thing didn anticipate dog owner even shelter volunteer and wouldn have been able handle previously obligatory list thing beyond the basic that experienced first time dog owner \ dog emotional support animal correct dog not esa her esa she came from rescue and she wa very incredibly anxious her first few week home she followed everywhere yes sound adorable but not when you realize that because your dog scared everything she follow whining and cry with her tail between her leg hurt for her because she felt this way she much much much better now but took lot time money and effort get her where she this doesn just apply shelter dog happens puppy directly from the litter well \ walk are not just walk the idea walking dog sound simple enough put them leash and just but that not all the calmest dog can adopt completely different persona leash and act completely bonkers leash reactivity leash reactive dog and take hour consistent training change this also have highly aware surroundings during walk come across more than few unleashed dog and have had some close call especially when they after dog there also have been many people who reach out pet dog without permission dog wa aggressive still wary regardless especially when there are kid involved this could result bite leading serious legal ramification even euthanization the shelter had protocol place for ensuring that dog were walked with minimal distraction but the outside world different walking dog exercise reading your environment your dog other dog and people \ dog have allergy knew that some dog can have mild allergy with the season but dog allergy are pretty bad moved from city country with her and there something about the air pollen grass that ha her red eyed and scratching been working with the vet figure out what and been trying multiple regimen for dog just quick note her eyedrop are per bottle which last about 2wks wipe her down from head tail with towelette whenever return from being outside and rinse her eye with saline twice day also been modifying her diet try help with the allergy her symptom are getting better but been month and still don know the exact cause her allergy \ training need happen with everyone and everywhere this mean socialization with people and animal and training need happen variety place from volunteering the shelter seen what happens when dog isn properly socialized biting jumping destruction etc dog need learn calm regardless how people approach them some dog view being patted the head threat but many people think this good way greet dog they also need properly introduced other dog neutral territory with potential shelter one get aggressive this training need reinforced all setting home outside vet pet supply store etc dog taught command only home then she think that those command only apply when she home spend good hour week solely dedicated training this doe not include feeding walking anything else dog and regularly drive over minute find new place and thing for her experience \ medical emergency happen the most inconvenient time and almost always the night before your 8am final everyone the dog household need onboard don allow her have table food then housemate have restrict her from table food well otherwise her reinforcement will inconsistent everyone the house ha involved training the dog yes she dog but are all her people \ even low maintenance dog requires maintenance nail trim brushing bath flea tick prevention heartworm prevention vaccination dog license etc dog that properly cared for take work and money dog walk pavement daily but isn quite heavy enough for the concrete file her nail she get her nail clipped every 2wks and some dog can real drama queen about getting their nail clipped she ha short hair but she ha serious undercoat that requires daily brushing many dog develop ear infection from who know what and those require lot care too also something didn think about before getting dog anal gland know this isn what you were hoping read when you posted don want say that you shouldn get dog right now but huge life change and responsibility dog owner anticipates giving their dog shelter the owner are often heartbroken about but happens time and time again because that fluffy big eyed puppy turned out more work and time and money than anticipated again love dog more than anything but glad that waited you mentioned that you been going through difficult time recently and sorry hear that you think your parent would open different pet none you are allergic the stereotype for cat that they aloof but met some very sweet puppy like cat while volunteering the shelter cat are generally much lower maintenance pet than dog and they hilarious roommate cat used sit the bathmat while wa showering and swat stray water droplet also this might unexpected suggestion but rat also are pretty cool they get bad rap but they cuddly and can trick now not good time for dog many the quality that people love about dog can found other animal ,0

thanks for the suggestion that sound like could really fruitful hadn thought that really love could breed miniature specifically for service work have also noticed that there only seem standard service but have also heard that miniature have similar nearly identical intelligence and temperament bit unsure what specifically autism service dog trained heard somewhere that they provide sensory input son definitely ha sensory need and social interaction without the complexity human socialization essence making somebody who feel though they can connect others naturally feel unconditionally loved and accepted their dog and thusly boosting their social confidence have look into that well but that would absolute dream thanks again ,0
dog doesn behave well leash like keep them fairly short leash and make sure dictate how and where walking for instance out there for exercise and the dog isn good leash won allow much sniffing and wandering rather just keep walking the dog ha walk keep with the dog pull stand still until she stop pulling even turn around and the other way opinion you have make clear the dog that you walking them not the other way around also fan prong and martingale collar they are harder slip out and they provide another signal the dog that tell them when they aren following your lead closely enough ,0
they tend have more sensitive temperament they just care about thing lot more accidentally getting their tail caught door would roll off lot dogs’ back but dog with shepherd type temperament may fearful that door from now unless ’ paired with lot counter conditioning and confidence building this le common gsds but more common dutchies and mals experience but some line have been specifically bred little socially leery the dog are bred for apprehension and ’ easier convince slightly nervous dog that someone “the bad guy” this can described “civil” the dog would bite civilian not just someone wearing training gear when this twitchiness nervousness social leery behavior not also paired with lot environmental confidence can turn into dog that anxious all the time lot the time with proper socialization the hope these dog can social with people until they are “turned ” and then that civil edge creep back and they’ great bite dog all these can super desirable trait you know what you’ doing and the dog are being produced responsibly but when the dog start being bred irresponsibly they socialization and confidence fly out the window and you just wind with anxious nervous dog that are prone fear aggression and reactivity they’ le likely able bounce back from scary unpleasant stimulus because they don’ have that genetic confidence fall back bad experience go looooong way with them that’ what people mean when they say they’ easy mess ,0

shelter also have been downplaying aggressive behavior dog some case completely covering dog aggression history passing them around different shelter and erasing their history and labeling pit and pit mix other breed like lab mix order adopt them out also play into the you can identify pit bull myth other than the bully and fighting breed there aren many dog that have that signature blocky head get people want save dog and the kill movement ha good intention but much resource are being used try and rehab super dangerous animal even dog that have attacked killed someone another animal some case seen people donate sign petition save pit bull who killed someone from euthanization sickens there isn that kind support for the victim put people danger pit bull require super experienced owner and most people aren equipped handle them doesn help that the pro pit lobby spread myth around super common social medium that make them look easier not better than say lab golden they say they were never bred for fighting have genetic dog aggression and say they were nanny dog they use the atts result proof even though test for working dog and ha nothing with friendliness and people are eating fatal dog attack used super rare now seeing increase since the michael vick drama more and more pit are being bred and taking most the room shelter leading lot people trying prove their pit bull good and doing thing like taking video picture their small infant riding the dog letting their pit wander off leash and taking dog aggressive pit dog park ,0

that actually what the breeder did that got pup from you basically just move the list let say she expected puppy for this october litter and you were number the list but there were only born you now number the list for the next litter her not answering your call and being flake rather weird though give another shot and try contacting her again let her know you still interested but worried ,0

thank you for taking time explain that make sense ,0

many people have given awesome detailed answer and don want beat dead horse will just share one thing that really stuck with have \ year old standard poodle ramses from reputable breeder grew with poodle and poodle mix parent chose that were either rescue from bybs the thing that wa hardest get used wa how fearless ramses firework problem vacuum problem car ride problem cow problem gunshot problem new person problem new dog problem sleeping pool floatie the middle lake problem all the poorly bred dog grew with would have reacted horribly these thing either retreating quivering mess growling and snapping sometimes still find myself bracing for that reaction even though never come ramses just want involved doesn even blink thing that would have been sure sign the apocalypse childhood dog the breeder chose parent with great temperament socialized the litter ton before they came home and continued that work ramses grew but realistically didn expose him every possible thing the key socialization window ha new experience all the time and handle them beautifully because that him ,0
yes think ’ that next week still haven’ gotten call back but also start the process reaching out other breeder well since experience with this one ha been bad normal list with more than one breeder ,0
you can search the sub for that term and get lot discussion ’ usually the dog reacting lunging and barking when see another dog while ’ leash this can come from place just wanting play place fear where the dog trying tell the other dog stay away ’ pretty common gsds and other shepherd ,0
reading through this sub ’ seen lot comment the tune shepherd are easy screw etc and ’ like know what sort thing could screw dog what are the technique activity avoid court67 ha covered most the point just like add that you missed critical socialization window just due the age adoption stop basic obedience keep doing positive exposure environment people place and thing this le about telling the dog that sit mean sit and more about getting the dog not consider everything the environment potential threat that could lead bite also don take current confidence mean future confidence keep doing positive exposure until maturity reward engagement and curiosity and like jack potting good recovery bad thing startle okay big deal that recovery slow little twitchy with personality step back and that create distance etc ,0
had the same thing happen when wa out walk when boy wa only few month old loved carrying stick course wa mix between you and your wife had the same process you did ended with ton puppy bite mark but the end are both fine ,0

get where you’ coming from here and basically think you’ right but think the problem that there doesn’ seem practical real world way allow real esas travel plane without opening thing peacock level ridiculousness one one hand there’ the highly trained completely reliable guide dog that make the life it blind owner immensely easier tangible and practical way the other there’ the mixed breed poorly trained and anxious esa dog that bit the face the passenger next them can’ imagine that helped the anxiety it owner either btw ’ spectrum and there need line drawn but won’ perfect and won’ make perfect logical sense either ,0

puppy101 ha great advice for this but this behavior normal redirect toy and continues more than time ahead and time out puppy and don learn when they over excited ,0
yep that doesn’ surprise unfortunately and ’ not necessarily from her previous owner the point whole comment and this post honestly that this genetic difference these dog not necessarily anyone’ fault other than the unscrupulous breeder that produced her feel comfortable placing blame them ,0
wa not able post this the ask vet subreddit but would have your vet test check for leptospirosis usually requires urine and blood run the test ,0
reactivity ha reasonably large genetic component sort part the breed and even with good breeder can crop breeder friend last litter had lot social reactivity wanting greet even though both parent are asocial thankfully with some basic impulse control training and premack work with ball thank you toy drive none those dog anymore but when you have dog with high drive and low frustration tolerance because puppy reactivity can crop pretty darn quickly ,0

agreed welcome the service dog world the community ha been grappling with this problem for decade but putting down others’ invisible disability objectively the wrong path talk shit about the people abusing the system all you want but don’ say that someone “not disabled enough” warrant dog guide dog have been people public too btw every category legitimate service dog ha they are animal not robot some form public access sociability test ha been floated around for while cci trying create standardized public access test and licensing system for service dog which sound great but could make service dog extremely inaccessible people who need them but unnecessarily difficult obtain these license certification due mostly their disability the reason they need the dog the first place ’ huge struggle and someone who ha been immersed service dog for year now ’ really disappointing see some the comment this thread that barely scratch the surface understanding what these dog can dismiss esas entirely put psychiatric service dog very very slippery slope ,0
yeah puppy raise dutchies and mali and they sharp just rotate them the point keep them occupied and using their brain not destroying thing for minute ,0
don think rude but let breeder know soon you can that you can taken off the list good breeder have many people the list that someone jumping ship really doesn make difference ,0
also share negative experience you ask for shared positive experience then ask for the experience compared byb obviously isn going fair assessment you only provide positive experience for one while not being held the same standard for the other either provide both side the equation not make the comparison all ,0
yes also considered getting mix such german shepherd collie mix but simply don know how find any breeder for these mix ,0
the byb got puppy from wa all the above well possible they crossed the breed achieve working dog that slightly more people friendly while maintaining the work ethic that make pyrenees pyrenees can sure didn ask however would have good working home return should that needed ,0
how did you find gsd mix this wa ideal breed but finding breeder for this mix rural kansa harder than you think ,0
the dog lept not and yes the tennant including the dog owner allowed use the apartment building they were not risk the dog wa leash and didn touch them presuming lept accurate from and puppy are not risk anyone safety except maybe small child you cannot allowed dog and then expected have complete control all time imagine wa boisterous child would having the same discussion ,0
man least doesn constantly when worked pet store there wa customer who would push three rat terrier shopping cart and they would bark non stop she thought wa hilarious ,0
sure some this due lack training wa owned family who did nothing with him but also just genetics how did you reach this conclusion did you find genetic marker for reactiveness and compare your other more well bred dog you said yourself some wa due lack training and socialization can both genetics and socialization issue but sound like you want blame one more than the other without evidence back the genetic portion the conclusion say your premise sound but the conclusion you reach illogical because doesn follow the premise dog reactive because lack socialization and training young age dog reactive because just genetics which argument provable which not studying the classic such the republic would give you great introduction argument structure ,0
think our pom about ten but don’ know his exact age because got him front the animal shelter definitely senior boy though don’ think you’ alone with the crate thing dog usually have fewer accident there because they are mostly sleeping just lying quietly dog need sleep lot anyway that’ why you’ see lot people this sub recommend crate training for when you’ not home supervise them course they can’ just kept there all the time though according the dog training book ’ read ’ almost certainly not trying bad when pee behind stuff probably just think ’ doing good going somewhere out the way where won’ his “living area” positive reinforcement like treat when go where you want him should happen every time according patricia mcconnell but for the time when you don’ want watching him like hawk think the belly band can really helpful for older dog carl doe not let know need out let him out schedule don’ use them like diaper but instead like safeguard for don’ let him out time like your dog dog hate the feel wet belly band know genuinely had accident soil one ,0
turn out the person jumped recently had surgery and apparently opened one their stitch and definitely made contact the dog did make contact and that how stitch got torn out and puppy are not risk anyone safety except maybe small child that utter garbage you think 70lb dog can knock someone down injure them what about people who just had surgery what about someone using cane are those people allowed outside your warped worldview you cannot allowed dog and then expected have complete control all time you something course you can expect someone have complete control their dog outside one home all time fact that exactly the legal standard imagine wa boisterous child pissed 70lb boisterous child threw themselves too the child injured you bet asking for medical expense and having the exact same discussion ,0

breeder are human some great communicator and some are terrible that doesn necessarily reflect their dog ability breeder life can become very busy around puppy time and just after not only are there vet visit dog issue puppy themselves but all the usual life emergency and then all the message goodness the message know breeder flat coated retriever she also ha dog oriented business the number message she get enormous being list good however doesn mean you getting puppy the next litter some litter can single puppy hard guess having deposit better but still doesn guarantee some breeder ultrasound try and figure out how many puppy are coming manage the process little better but puppy can die birth shortly thereafter still tough could that you are one two place down the list and the breeder wa waiting hear back from others that doesn excuse the lack feedback eye but have seen people react that way next time very clear that you would like puppy and offer put deposit that what ended doing ,0
saw this missing dog post recently instagram samoyed puppy got lost and ha microchip there reason people don’ microchip isn’ pretty cheap ,0
never buy mix from breeder they aren ethically bred and there are thousand shelter already ,0
found puppy craigslist the owner the parent dog were actually selling loss because the intent wa not breed the dog you would better off reaching out the seller setting meeting attending said meeting meet the dog find violation the law and report those violation should you find any you flag each post and some puppy don get adopted the unscrupulous type will most likely away with them rather than keep them not condoning breeding puppy unknown origin for the purpose selling them but not every person posting looking make quick buck ,0
you are still going want harness though don connect your dog collar the seat belt ,0
will try get checked out thank you ,0
your job farm for you have large yard perhaps you could buy some goat ,0
don’ think this playing dog doesn’ play with another dog grabbing it “whole body her jaws” prey drive not something you can just get rid your poor cat probably constantly stressed this new dangerous environment keep them completely separated unless you are able help your dog develop better impulse control and even that happens never let them together when you’ not home but unfortunately think you have really hard decision make the near future ,0
you like the herding type but want dog that more able chill consider sheltie they will take much activity you can give them but most them can just hang and have downtime the main drawback that they are inveterate barker and you have really consciously train them away from the positive side they also very intelligent personable and easy train they good intro herding breed ,0
watching puppy interact with his mom wa hilarious the first thing did wa try for some milk lol but after that just watching him around her wa cute you could see his whole demeanor change stood straight when saw her walked slightly differently and had this funny smile his face joked that wa standing straight impress mom sadly wasn there watch him with his brother saw some photo though ,0
pretty widely acknowledged the dog world that genetically reactive dog will usually begin showing that reactivity around maturity dog wa not reactive when brought him home month old wa perfectly fine with other dog and stranger laid down the floor petsmart and watched people pas with issue trained him from month with usual method rewarded positive behavior managed and minimized the opportunity for bad behavior can absolutely say that his previous owner did not abuse him they simply didn train him take him off their farm month old began reaching maturity started body blocking other dane then started guarding toy and food then started raising his hackle stranger and strange dog then started barking stranger and strange dog and then started lunging forward stranger and strange dog event triggered this behavior nothing bad happened him while wa care his genetics kicked around physical maturity they tend think that even had owned this dog from week onward still would have turned into reactive and quite frankly dangerous dog argument about reactivity are provable can look risk factor and ass their probable contribution behavior dog had many risk factor wa puppy mill dog nature raised without any training socialization nurture the thing lack training and socialization isn going turn genetically stable dog into unstable dog unless there are outside factor trauma abuse you could take stable dog from well bred litter and raise farm with family and the dog going turn out okay unless abused ha some sort single multiple event trauma the rapidity with which dog became aggressively reactive with single multiple event trauma quite clearly anyone who know anything about training dog result poor genetics perhaps influenced the result poor socialization and training ,0
court67 and helleraine pretty much have covered but add another dimension that first time owner may not think maybe just gsd but there this extra attention detail that make training gsd little more difficult than other biddable working dog like they carrying around little copy the rule and constantly taking note based observation this mean their interpretation the rule may based different detail than the one you find relevant and also mean they will find and exploit every loophole your training and management experienced trainer can avoid problem structuring their training account for all the potential pitfall from the start first timer may not consider some the hole until they problem and then you have back and fix them which take more time and frustration ,0
and side note you seem pretty strongly opposed argument about ethical breeding one would wonder why you participating sub and repeatedly commenting comment that support ethical breeding wholeheartedly ,0
original post said lept least that the way read ha clarified that and have updated original statement ,0
’ just been doing own research for curiosity reason and some article from vet say stick with the same one but others say ’ better give your dog range different nutrient which seems make sense said dog doesn’ really seem have issue with wa just curious for some other perspective ,0
use prong collar and the dog don seem mind them they better than choke collar halti gentle leader which they hate ,0
how vet recommended them ’ used them year problem the prong are smooth and they don’ crush their larynx pulling the tightest you make the circumference the neck even sharp leash snap doe what ’ designed for get attention without hurting them the biggest thing never leave them never come from walk and take off ,0

definitely not just your gsd haha echo particular absolutely obsessive about the “rules” and ha very finely tuned “fairness meter” last repetition did three ball throw between heeling pattern but this time think can get away with just two boy not echo’ watch the payment for heeling wa ball throw last time better ball throw forever this may out the scope some pet training but doe make increasing criterion tricky with these guy because they figure thing out quick and then cling them you have raise criterion surprisingly quickly they don’ think they already know the full behavior when actually you’ only halfway there and then they get frustrated and stuck ,0

think come down any form high prey drive and aggression for your average joe going hard raise high prey drive like malamute husky wolfhound greyhound bloodhound aggression like pit bull chihuahua rottweiler great pyrenees dachshund not necessarily hardest raise but people that get breed based the lifestyle they want live rather than the one they actually live they find hard when the dog doe what wa bred you see post like how get great pyrenees stop barking why won high prey drive sight hound not leave cat alone ,0

would love you could explain that one more fully not quite sure understand your reasoning the correlation causation thing typically used dismiss argument claiming that cause accurate the argument ha demonstrate that doe not even indirectly influence there just shared factor that cause flawed emotional perception that the two thing are linked cause and effect not just proximity you can just throw out you wrong correlation casuality the end you have actually show the problem simply saying shelter population are affected far more not sufficient here claiming that pit bull being difficult raise cause their high rate abandonment surrender you claim that simply matter high number pit bull bred and produced irresponsible owner there are least two problem with that when breed difficult own that creates irresponsible owner the minimum wage 19yo who buy aussie end very different owner than the minimum wage 19yo who buy say boerboel the latter just 100 more demanding house handle and confine owner end nuisance owner end menace all because the dog different tendency there are far more people breeding and selling small cute dog and labradoodles than there are selling pit bull the there entire puppy mill industry which pump out puppy and sell them online for credit card number and shipping fee many those dog suffer from healthy behavior issue due lousy vet care and isolation critical early puppyhood many become difficult pet thereby but all the shelter are pit bull clearly there are factor involved pit bull rearing which not arise rearing other breed even those that have the worst possible origin and are doomed problematic pet ,0
have him evaluated qualified behaviorist growling important communication and usually distancing behavior that doesn sound quite like going but your pup could conflicted wanting attention and afraid without someone with some skill observing his behavior hard suggest plan ,0
went through the same thing with year old dog month ago just realized today would have been her 11th birthday she seemed really weak when got home from trip tuesday that night took her and she got diagnosed with spleenic mass and low platelet and admitted brought her home wednesday when the vet told that surgery would only give her month because had already metastasized her lung thursday after talking regular vet decided make appointment for euthanasia saturday wa the hardest decision ever had make she seemed pretty much normal friday and saturday she even wa running and barking people lot the people talked said they would probably wait for another hemorrhage but the end and after talking few people who said always worse too late than too early went through with the appointment she fell down from the ketamine while standing and wagging her tail and eating chocolate out hand never cried much cry right now what ha helped knowing that every day that you might have waited would have been for not them they were already that sick they probably had been discomfort for some time maybe not terrible discomfort but isn our job keep them from feeling any pain long within our power during and since felt lot guilt about not noticing that she wa slowing down she must have had that tumor for least half year taken her for 6th month senior appointment maybe they could have done something also felt lot guilt about being gone for out the last day her life maybe she wouldn have started hemorrhaging been home what what what those thing drive you crazy and sure you know they don help but normal think actually talking people here reddit few people let them before the euthanasia wa probably the best thing for for getting past the guilt and immediate grief you are part community where all have gone through similar choice and understand everything you are feeling best luck healing from this hope that every day your positive memory lucy will help you slowly get past the other feeling x200b ,0
yeah the dog ha some natural instinct that kick but looking for something that train them deal with like how dog are naturally protective but don actually know how deal with intense situation basically want the dog detect wildlife and track like hunting book dunno ,0

sound like really awkward way saying “started crying” based context clue ,0
well finding good breeder requires old fashioned kind networking you might start googling national regional local breed club and getting some name but after that about building relationship via email phone and person meeting people show competition training facility etc not internet only kind project many good breeder don even have website you find them via word mouth and they talk you because someone put good word for you ,0
purely anecdotal observation incoming the dog next door bark everything that go past postie bike people walking other dog everything own dog only ever bark other dog dog ha learned that when next door dog give certain type bark mean that there dog walking past and race the fence can bark too barking ignore happily but the hey dog there dog dog over here dog bark reacts guess yeah they can communicate ,0
this absolutely foolish and dangerous the muzzle will prevent dog from defending itself from unmuzzled animal your dog muzzled for any reason social interaction should never that reason your dog can’ socialize without biting the other dog people then you need seek professional training help not reaching for the muzzle ,0
member local club affiliate for the akc and also some web development speaking from experience breeder website are some the worst you see way out date horribly organized lacking useful information etc unfortunately the internet not good tool for finding breeder hard believe this day and age case through club membership have lot personal contact with serious dog owner can generally work way through reputable breeder and even then most the best one only litter sporadically and usually have waiting list yeah tough ,0
trauma horrible thing just think about soldier who war and aren able recover don doubt some dog are similar and his pain and fear following the attack wa just too great maybe intensive behavior conditioning program over the course year but don think you should give yourself heartache over what might have been ,0
the akc marketplace garbage right the breed club website you would have saved yourself lot time and heartache ,0
sorry this happened afraid sometimes the mental damage go deep can helped dog therapist would able elaborate better sometimes they can help work thing out but not always think letting them the end wa the best you could for them horrible live constant fear stressed out and the alert for another attack all the time and turn hurting the people they love sorry came that hope the idiot owner that vicious dog got what they had coming for what happened get angry reading post about people with dog that are aggressive towards other dog not doing their due diligence keep their dog under proper control avoid incident like this ,0
would risk because not risk all rubbing alcohol completely safe cheap and readily available and excellent solvent also clean house with bleach and somehow manage avoid drinking much that die ,0
make sense ,0
the thing you want help for what appears fairly minor behavior little growling when someone new come into the house bark bark and lunge people passing lot dog that and most owner don particularly worry about unless the dog scaring them that typically when people start looking train their dog when they sense that the dog fairly normal minor aggressive behavior have more potential for escalation than the average dog just kinda wonder about this for you and your pit bull because the waffling aggressive but trust issue lunging people lot but great dog need real training behave normally but really making progress already big red flag that dog owner frightened for the future the dog love pit bull lab cur mix pit bull mix you can complain and rush explain his true heritage everyone you meet and staple dna result his head and will have one effect will make you look like pit bull owner stop fretting over ridiculous unimportant stuff like what you call your pet and the best euphemism employ while describing his behavior start worrying about the behavior and how change and how handle him maximize his chance becoming more secure le aggressive animal ,0
incorrect quite few excellent trainer recommend muzzle training tool course you don’ put muzzled dog around vicious dog but you shouldn’ putting yourself your dog around that sort dog anyway dog who overreact need way learn proper social interaction without the escalation that their bite could cause wearing muzzle let them interact with other dog socially helping them learn also allows one take their dog out alone without worrying about their dog starting something even dog with issue need exercise and decompression time arguably more than well adjusted dog person with dog who biting snapping should work with qualified trainer behaviorist absolutely but say that muzzle never the right choice incorrect and there are plenty trainer who will agree with one you can look sarah the cognitive canine who ha blog and podcast that often touch this topic ,0
agreed maybe pomchi ,0
sorry about the puppy imo collar should worn all the time because microchip aren foolproof they can move some shelter vet don scan properly etc but keep guy collar loose enough for him easily slip out walked harness and doesn wear the crate think that probably safe compromise ,0

know the anxiety waiting unbearable but take thing one step time and first find out what you are dealing with before you decide what you the extent the metastasis will determine what your option are and your vet should have recommendation based your boy specific case what others have done would isn necessarily reflection what may best for you and your boy sorry for the diagnosis aggressive and nasty ,0

someone posted about keeping their dog collar loose compromise and seems have deleted the comment just wanted say those reading this and considering that option that loose collar arguably more dangerous that more likely get caught than snug and once tangled and tight won matter how much space there once wa the very least wouldn consider le dangerous everyone need make the right choice for their dog and situation but please don complacent thinking that loose collar prevents this risk ,0

none those thing mean the breeder aren breeding that the list out date though the phone number were ced guess the phone number were old but can see how would easy forget update your number with the club wa the point this post finding good breeder hard like job interview your email cover letter response mean you didn impress them enough warrant response there small handful good breeder and they get hundred inquiry week sometimes especially around the holiday you need stand out and show that you know you not just looking for dog you looking for quality dog from great breeder your introductory email should lay out your dog related resume and indicate that you done some amount research into why the breed good fit for you never ask about cost upfront never mention color preference sex preference front you need make connection with the breeder before you start talking about the specific the dog you want especially when you probably going matched your puppy temperament and not necessarily sex and color basically get what you get ,0

while there are certain breed and individual dog with stomach issue think for many it not problem since summer been switching dog food every month great effect used sometimes bored with his food and not really eat but since switching brand meat never not been excited his coat excellent condition and healthy and happy ever recommend others but have been downvoted for saying personally wouldn want eat just one meal even were salmon and potato every day life why would dog want plus like that different brand have different concentration vitamin carbs protein ratio like that getting overall more balanced diet get some everything ,0
you more research that true only this food change done typically with dog who have remained the same diet for year and the sudden change doe overwhelm their system and thus why the general vet advice slow change because it under the assumption you changing from one long term food type another will long term food type but you commit rotate diet change brand meat focus every mont your dog will adapt and you not going have issue the same with human for example long term vegetarian will get sick least nauseous when they eat meat for the first time after multiple year without because you say their gut flora ha changed but mostly vegetarian who eats meat once month once week won have that issue their body will have adapted ,0
what about treat with stronger smell pup’ favorite treat her beggin strip they’ pretty smelly compared her other treat the smelliest treat ever fed dog wa salmon strip jerky ’ pretty pricey though maybe hiding thing corner instead under thing ,0
didn mention what contacted the breeder with original post but pretty much did contact those with doggie resume sort consisted introduction and how found their into brief paragraph history owning the breed paragraph asking question determine they health tested and their breeding practice nowhere did mention price upfront first contact nor did mention color sex and always let them know wasn rush get dog and wa willing put wait list communication got that far wa pretty much going the book regard how contact breeder and wasn getting any response other than some real flaky back yard breeder that being said the breed club website wa mostly out date info the flaky breeder were from other personal site ,0
you don’ need breed specific rescue google “dog rescue zip code ” many private rescue group will have information about surrendering dog make sure that you and your husband are the registered owner the dog reputable rescue will only take surrender from the dog’ legal owner for obvious reason also ensure that the dog current all his shot this will help with surrender rehoming ,0
first thing first matter what the result the scan you should seeing oncologist you aren already the oncologist will able lay out all the option available you regardless how the scan turn out and they able give you more realistic expectation than typical vet second mention the lump his nose you haven already they may choose fine needle aspirate biopsy may nothing but also may something third nobody know the best course action for your dog but you nobody can make the big decision but you there are right wrong answer osteosarcoma shitty disease matter what route you will say here that amputation the single most effective form pain relief for dog with osa extremely painful cancer and dog whose owner opt for palliative care only wind being uncontrollable pain that get them euthanized more often than not amputation alone may even buy him some time especially there evidence metastatic spread this point biopsy ha not been performed there small chance could actually chondrosarcoma rather than osa and chondrosarcoma ha much much better prognosis than osa ,0
seconded great pyrenees rescue wisconsin looking like good one contact com ,0

are you looking for puppy adult dog considering you want low maintenance dog puppy probably isn’ the best thing for you all puppy are high maintenance also smarter dog usually are bred working dog shepherd retriever sled dog breed and hunting breed which all require lot exercise and need more time dedicated them than hour day considering this would your first pet and you work full time might not the best time for you get dog consider getting cat first they are lot le maintenance comfortable with just laying around with you and good start learning the responsibility and time involved taking care animal also far know most dog are not going the independent animal that you’ looking for considering that they are “pack” animal and look you for everything all honesty the dog that you’ describing that you want reality cat ,0
when you buy from shelter you help support that shelter continue carrying for and networking for dog that need home while buying from backyard breeder directly line their pocket with money and encourages them create more dog that will die from neglect end shelter ’ pretty obvious which those option are “okay” and which one isn’ the exact definition backyard dog poorly bred that’ what make their breeder backyard breeder ,0

think this too but the back head hear dumb cesar milan saying dog shouldn pulling when they walk there actually dvd out called heeling just another trick something along those line same thing with dog pulling the leash merely another trick skill that need trained for the cold that can concern morning walk are bit harsh and afternoon that much warmer just one walk and make longer one lot dog don like booty and take time condition them ,0
but what about the one who offend again and again after they are released john venaballs for example ,0
took her out without the other dog who older and ha good leash manner but difficult train one dog with another one there and pocket full treat don want separate them since they such good friend but also think this probably the best solution husband can take one and can take the other maybe just know tough with two tiny dog tangling two leash underneath foot ,0
same plus first dog wa bit jerk she wa rescue with some baggage she improved over time with training but she wa still fluffy little asshole loved that jerk dog much though and didn want her someone who would give her she passed away after made much better place life ,0
that probably true lol wasn worked just didn get you right the answer dont but everyone going say that and then they might still through with wanted them make the most responsible irresponsible decision possible ,0

sure crate him when you not home but also make sure that you meeting his activity need well tired dog happy dog have year old pit and she nut don exercise her and our daily training activity lucky have yard that she can run full speed but day where the yard way too wet take her extra long walk day where weather isn permitting outside activity play hide and seek together you give them their favorite toy treat and then hide when ready call them and let the fun ensue these thing are necessary for your dog especially since sound like bored when alone but will also help make sure doesn literally eat his way out his crate good luck ♡ ,0

you find way let know dog enjoys nice pile cat shit well and often get quite sick from chain link fence and garlic spray certainly don’ work let pomeranian chase them when catch them the yard but unfortunately they can tell ’ not actually aggressive they’ actually stray ’ honestly best call animal control homeless cat have high attrition rate the winter and for their kitten ’ even higher ’ more likely that the cat have home and your neighbor are just irresponsible owner ’ lot trickier some people seem feel ’ their cat’ right roam wherever and they often overlap with the kind people who think calling the city about their pet cat constitutes the start neighbor war ,0
only adopt don’ see the point going breeder when there are animal need not looking show dog have working dog don’ care what animal look like for the companion that right for ,0
awhhh way they have pretty much the same marking look sleepy ’ adorable what breed ,0

anyone who think that pampering dog millennial phenomenon need only look far boston terrier and other companion breed proven wrong boston aren’ particularly old breed first bred revolutionary war era boston admitted the akc 1893 but during their time they’ occupied pretty solidly cushy place society learning stupid pet trick jpg riding jpg the car doing whatever this jpg the reality the very people these photo are our parent grandparent and great grandparent people have always done silly seemingly unreasonable thing with their dog because love them and they are our family even though the goalpost have shifted society ha changed that underlying desire certainly hasn’ ,0

there are pro and con short they keep each other company the crate which reduces whining night and they can play and develop social skill the hard part that they feed off each other they escape they will bolt and hard catch twice the vet bill twice the food twice the bowl twice the treat etc add ,0
didnt say anything about irresponsible breeding ,0
reputable breeder wont sell you two together that kind decide that for you ,0

want goat and sheep and barn cat two and many many dog ,0
you can crate him then someone ha with him always crating the only way ensure can get into thing you not home she doesn want crate him then other avenue like doggie daycare house sitter for him are your other option exercise training and experiencing new thing will help him but ha done multiple time day let say that you take him the park for bit that way can have some fun are you doing anything else with him there are you exercising and engaging him before after that activity are you taking him every day know that bored and would want put bullet through head wa allotted only one thing fun let alone wasn every day dog have the mentality child you can take kid the park once and then have them quiet and well behaved would unfair hold your dog impossible standard like that well were your shoe and these were not option would have acknowledge that home isn the best home for him and seek out avenue rehoming him dog need lot and much bigger commitment than just food water shelter and vet visit daily routine for dog day that work let them out the bathroom feed them after morning routine run them outside yard interacting with them playing with them and going over obedience command with them for least minute take them walk least minute now that they more tired lock them room now that they tired and will behave repeat 0600 0800 routine day that off include adding extra playtime extra walk along with going for hike able that way they can have fun adventure dog age are year year and year you want them behave you have put the work that they need and adjust your lifestyle around theirs otherwise you shouldn have dog that not being mean nor meant confrontational combative tone just someone telling you the truth ,0
have you heard littermate syndrome you want able walk one dog time when theyre older without the other freaking out the answer the second question yes dont this puppy bond more closely with eachother than human this mean that instead caring about you and your family the best thing ever they see the other puppy that way this can mitigated but they always need sleep eat train exercise and play with you separately they really should only get hour playtime together day are you for raising two puppy basically two separate room until theyre over year ,0
they keep each other company the crate you really should not crate two dog together only take one disagreement and now you have two fighting dog crate neither dog can get away diffuse the situation and the dog are different enough size you can easily have dead smaller dog ,0

rescue texas prefer the adopt route both dog are rescue have zero need for dog come from breeder okay with people going reputable breeder although not all rescue are the question becomes what reputable breeder because see all too many that are not personally believe reputable breeder should minimum genetic testing avoid breeding known issue will not breed the mother too early will not overbreed the mother will make sure that all age appropriate medical care provided will least some investigation the potential purchaser and will require that the dog returned them need homed for any reason for why some rescuer can anti breeder general consider pvac shelter the rio grande valley area texas the beginning this year they partnered with apa try improve their live release rate return owner adoption transfer rescue the goal get them above they take thousand dog and cat per year they get that mean average dog and cat are being put down per day getting them would still mean average dog cat per day would euthanized and that single shelter texas backyard breeder and irresponsible owner account for the vast majority this but otherwise good breeder who not have any sort takeback program don help and then see and deal with the raid the breeder ill repute dog crammed into small cage covered feces and sore the one knowingly selling pup that have been exposed distemper parvovirus when you see all the above can hard remember that good breeder are out there but know several good one that are involved rescue x200b ,0
you willing drive hour why not visit shelter larger area ,0
put the context human had hairline fracture twist sprain the work and doctor say take week off well little tender and sore but fine and can work athlete play through serious injury artist have had their best show while suffering the flu etc etc etc dog can govern themselves the same way dog ha had knee jam that should rest for week but the next day and ready rock give him two antibiotic down for the weekend who tell him how feeling dog will let you know what about the time not vet but say try keep him relaxed but also let him his own pace when want stretch out bit ,0

well make sense reputable breeder would not adopt out two pup then how often doe this happen had idea they could end hating each other that common occurrence ,0
addition what others said this can become really really bad issue something happens one the dog imagine you lose one them prematurely cancer the remaining dog may literally not survive the separation ,0
you socialize and train both puppy why problem top what the other poster have said you are making the job training immensely more difficult incredibly hard train dog that won focus you because all their attention their littermate you end with dog that just ignore you because they only interested each other ,0
call animal control and have them trap them and adopt out ,0
yeah shrink back quite bit over the course month ,0
yes ,0
you can ask your vet about having them removed sometimes the only relief they get also did you know that expressing them too much can cause problem well ,0

adopted puppy from craigslist some would say backyard breeder but they were farm dog three pyrenees and one malamute the puppy amazing health issue temperament issue nothing you can learn more about the dog the people who have the dog you meet the puppy and the people seem sketchy probably isnt something you should support however experience wa positive the people didnt fit the description backyard breeder and wa definitely not puppy mill any kind purist here wont like but worked out for ,0
’ done hour drive each way with dog there are many rest stop along highway that wasn’ problem got relieve himeslef grass every couple hour also forced take break which wa plus have fun ,0

just got wonderful lgd from rescue fortunately there few lgd rescue near where live wa able meet few before adopting depending what you looking for might actually recommend getting your lgd from rescue because you can adopt year old you better able see temperament whereas you won too sure your puppy lgd temperament until gone through puberty where will likely change significantly ,0
don really care about myself and don let other get have way better thing focus than pup ha been mistaken for girl get mistaken for quite often since poodle poodle cut and they are seen very feminine breed they are apologetic first for having called him pretty instead handsome but tell then very pretty boy both pretty and handsome ,0
not sure honest large mix dad wa boxer mix mother wa elkhound mix ,0
the puppy amazing health issue temperament issue nothing according your post history you’ had this dog about month and got week making this dog like week old barring very serious physical temperamental issue virtually all puppy are fine this age you haven’ even hit fear period yet hip dysplasia doesn’ usually become issue until like month the very earliest for serious case and ccl rupture and other orthopedic issue common poorly bred extra large breed dog often don’ show until well into sexual maturity thing like dog aggression don’ usually manifest until closer year please don’ encourage people buy off craigslist when you have zero idea how your dog going turn out long term ,0
used live near dog swimming pool yes pool just for dog wa indoors and heated and they had bunch class you could multiple time week maybe see there something like that your area that should good her joint but tap lot energy ,0
when you mix two different breed there predictability what the puppy will like all they can range from strongly after one breed heavy mixture both and everything between this not just physical but behaviour well you just don know what trait they will have until they are fully grown for large breed that can year before all their trait are fully expressed ,0
anyone tell you their craigslist puppy didn’ come from byb puppy mill they were fooled themselves depending where you are may take some time monitoring shelter and rescue nearby find appropriate pup alternatively you are interested purebred puppy from reputable breeder you could fill out the questionnaire the side bar get some recommendation for smaller breed fit your lifestyle ,0
the dog ha seperation anxiety and they may working through this keep trying speak them seperation anxiety can very difficult break let hope they are working there as off change ,0
had similar issue with dog when she wa young and shortly after getting her did the leaving for increasing period time and would give her something she really liked when left peanut butter kong this ended working after some time completely understand the not wanting bother your neighbor lived apartment then also and gave serious anxiety worrying about bothering neighbor really just take some time lot thing with training dog just try find something your dog really enjoys and only give them when you leave they will have something look forward and not just focus you being gone best luck ,0
had her since july definitely working that currently really frustrating and break heart ,0
yes the separation anxiety part very obvious the fact that they are not doing anything about this clearly abusive situation because ha been going for month now and only getting worse the day the neighbor clearly not care about the dog welfare trying figure out what can for this animal well for own sanity ,0
doggy separation anxiety suck would never call animal control isn being abused simply anxious that they leave will destroy the house they have crate you get chance talk them you could offer some suggestion that might calm the dog such covering the crate leaving the for noise ,0
why can you spell chihuahua that all can see ,0
got beagle’ removed and never had another problem but were warned that the success rate wa guarantee ,0
have two young dog they month apart and didn get the second one until wa month old littermate syndrome wasn issue and still tiring some day they get walked separately for the majority walk trained separately for the majority training session and general just have very different need they went through adolescence the same time they not always sync sigh each other because they still working through their own quirk adore them both and think the effort 100 worth and actually feel like could have done owen came home week and louis wa month but definitely would have had more exhausting day and none the above prevent littermate syndrome said with the age and the timing wasn concern all that just make sure two adolescent dog become well trained level headed adult dog there way you getting there with uncontrolled walk and half assed training session can get proper focus when they can establish inside and outside with heel one day but not this age they both still under year old though louis will monday and all this would made even harder they didn give two shit about and only cared about themselves would never want dog that prefers dog over this isn everything about issue this safety issue need dog come with recall even they having fun time playing together need dog actually care when tell them they need something have child visit lot sometimes child are clumsy and fall drop thing don react fast enough and dog get whatever child food they shouldn have need able stop dog minimize issue not have dog nah dog doing going yes need dog priority ,0
you don think that leaving him panic inside crate for hour day abusive should add that never see them taking him for walk taking outside the apartment see them walking him maybe once every couple week whereas see all other neighbor with their dog out and about daily these people are literally abandoning the dog inside cage for most the day every day ,0
often the worse heartbreaking thing pet owner ha ever done nearly impossible find puppy off there that not from irresponsible breeder puppy producer out only for profit sold under false pretence stolen many people find out that their animal ha serious health issue that can affect them their entire life sometimes tragically short life they are often from dog that are not screened for mental fitness and can have serious fear reactivity aggression issue issue that make them difficult own safely and restrict their enjoyment life most people that save money end spending way more the long term deal with cheap puppy costing them more than responsibly bred one ,0
they ran complete blood count blood chemistry electrolyte ehrlichia anaplas lyme test even have the result but unsure what looking and something tell the vet wa the same way they told wa likely his liver but his kidney were fine trying figure out can get another vet view the report and see what they recommend also thinking about getting ultrasound his liver and bile duct see there anything going there but current vet did not ever mention bile suggest this ultrasound have wait because live smaller town and they have send this specific test off bigger lab ,0
have had cat since early twenty and gone through really hard time while having them wa abusive relationship broke with that person who then died overdose few month later had huge fall out with group friend had roomate who wa close with steel ton money from some more friend died the list go based these event it pretty hard for have faith people and often feel alone there were many time where considered killing myself but couldn deal with the thought leaving cat anyone else care plus the fact that they seem like mean lot since like them much more then people sorry know this dog thread but help work with dog and they are wonderful ,0

first thought you meant you brought your dog place think animal are sensitive you like your emotion pain level don’ think all dog but some are better than others ,0
get great emotional support from animal have condition that would “qualify” for esa but also don’ think ’ unreasonable that simply find pet friendly housing the first place begin with the only other benefit flight flight are very stressful would comfortable taking one dog flight esa because wa service dog and would able handle but subjecting regular pet flying simply cruel honest opinion cramped space crowded with stranger taking off loud noise are enough make even the most mild mannered dog nervous and unpredictable without proper training however since dog neither service dog esa will not flying with agree that esa’ are helpful but don’ think ’ necessary put them into their own defined class ’ interested hear you feel differently though ’ always good stay open minded case there’ scenario you hadn’ thought ,0
haha dog doe that wife too but both don suffer from back pain ,0
just because you find easy find pet friendly housing doesn’ mean everyone else doe can very difficult find such accommodation depending your location because you simply have problem doe not mean others don’ some people have more severe condition when come flying and maybe their pet don’ have problem with either don’ think ’ place judge other people’ need and condition simply because you someone else would not utilize the legal benefit would choose use them myself find fully necessary give them their own class because their purpose drastically different from actual service dog and those dog require the benefit they have while esa requires completely different set ,0
thank you for considering your dog well being and happiness well your own think that getting lost some the reaction one must really consider whether the stress air travel fair subject them you yourself find very stressful but least you have the intellectual capability understand will that way and why the dog don know what they getting into and they get stressed out and sometimes act out way that hurt others sorry for whatever going your life that necessitates esa and glad you able find comfort from your two dog ,0

just clarify would never attempt judge someone’ need condition and that’ not the message hoped convey with reply just didn’ understand the need for legal class esa regardless how severe condition wa given that pet friendly housing exists and you explained the flaw logic there not everyone had access pet friendly housing still disagree flying imo ’ just too stressful for animal that’ not been trained for anything anxious owner would only make worse for the dog unless the dog ha been trained deal with which case the dog could considered service dog and not esa given that ’ been specially trained for the task hand curious see the bearing this ha psychiatric service dog though the acaa differentiates them from regular service dog for some reason ,0

visited moro myself and even more confident now about them and will getting future pup from there x200b the occurrence breeding before proper health clearance wa because the sire wa smart learned open all the door and about pleased when the litter wa born from this the breeder were very careful and believe they were not charging the usual amount and only using pet pricing friend family locally think they fixed this issue making much harder for the sire dam open door though that might have just been very exceptional occurrence x200b not exactly looking for show dog not too worried about them getting title for their own dog the pricing seems fair even without them working hard get their own title for their pup especially relative some other breeder been looking though may missing something the health and temperament evaluation look thorough and well done when saw real one for one their past litter x200b think your point are definitely worth thinking about and valid but recommend going the breeder meet sydney and their pup might change your mind about them x200b overall really really appreciate the time you spent sending this thank you much ,0

this good example but it bit more involved considering that the dog living being the car break down you either fix get new car you arent just going replace sick dog and sometimes they cant fixed and go into the ethic producing dog that may not certified parent actually should have certain health clearance certified well couple the puppy start with with certified dog car you are stacking the deck your favor issue with not being certified you are taking risk but with dog not being certified you are supporting breeder that arent making any effort produce dog who will have long healthy life that make sense ,0

you give your dog treat attention after ha gone the bathroom maybe ha associated poop with attention would say doe again correct with firm right away and gross may sound don’ throw back the yard because that simulates game fetch instead throw the trash outside flush down the toilet then show him the correct thing when want attention which bring you toy something grabbing toy and letting him tug and praising ,0
that would completely unacceptable behavior for someone trust take care dog she might perfectly nice person otherwise but would never use her walk dog again and your position would tell friend and anyone else know not use her and why everyone ha bad day and get frustrated gotten angry and yelled dog couple time when she wa younger and destroyed something particularly high value which wa bad behavior part and when that happened recognized that wa angry and put her outside until calmed down certainly did not hit her that beyond frustrated and into doe not need dealing with animal for living territory yeah you basically did just see babysitter beat kid ,0

don’ know the specific your situation but depending the type animal shelter you are adopting from would really careful just taking their word thing like this live suburb major city the humane society the city proper ha gone strict kill and result they have huge glut almost solely bully breed mix many which they adamantly claim are good with cat based very superficial test they the facility which are not representative two animal interacting home they also claimed nearly all their puppy are good with cat matter course even though later learned this sub that puppy not necessarily blank slate and individual’ real tendency aren’ always clear before puberty visit with bully breed puppy dog were really pushed when would inquire about other dog saw petfinder ended going smaller shelter run animal control actual suburb and felt lot le pressure get dog that wasn’ safe fit with the pet cat had already made lifelong commitment ,0
you don really give much information how old the dog what breed are you getting from breeder rescue shelter you have kid the home you have other animal such cat the home advice can vary quite bit based off those answer you don already have dog selected fill out the breed questionnaire and can give you some suggestion based off that since the right dog for you can vary pretty dramatically based off your lifestyle and your preference general advice your first indoor dog find reputable trainer your area who us positive reinforcement technique minimum take basic obedience course basic obedience generally focus teaching dog the essential good behavior and beyond that help you learn how communicate effectively with your dog which something often not nearly good like think are ,0
thanks much hygiene good can butt and paw are wiped everytime come back from outside and bedding constantly washed take your advice wash the pup more often then ,0

dog can sometimes pick thing miss certainly they are not however infallible judge character situation you had good feeling about the person they had good reference and most importantly healthy and well behaved dog their own you can feel pretty safe leaving your dog with them there way know why your dog wa upset but everything else looked great wouldn too concerned about ,0
actually after asking pet owner about blown away that people have issue with petting pet all the people asked normal looking and acting people all say yeah great give them something while they away and let them socialize and all the people who said not cool are super sketchy people you afraid talk public because they unkept and their dog are clear reflection while talk them the dog either friendly reclusive like the owner this seems like issue the owner when they see their animal property object that owned and controlled anyone behaved that way with real people they call abusive relationship some people are socially messed the only conclusion could come ,0

got dog when wa high school who wa abandoned his previous owner not surrendered but just left the side the road think that the last thing they did wa take his collar off him all his life with would get very nervous any time took his collar off and wouldn leave dad side until wa back soon wa back calmed down immediately who know what your pup remembers what connection make even doesn connect being surrendered doubt that wa particularly happy time his old home give some extra hug from ,0
agreed with everything you said this line just made chuckle because wa imagining the top bad breed choice for dog who will living dorm lol for sure there real trend lately esa and ridiculously unsuitable breed being owned and trained people who have never had dog before think some come down wanting look different amazing whatever and some just not understanding that there reason why the big program use certain breed and stay away from others read many story people who wash out dog after dog and keep thinking the average lab golden would have been fine and worked out and not needed washed out but hey ,0
thank you ,0
just because isn trained the thing rando want doesn mean isn trained yes like when someone walk one dog and asks them shake hand and thinking under what circumstance would want dog think shaking hand with stranger good idea ,0

dog are not people dog are animal their original purpose wa work for not like people coming out nowhere and petting dog yet dog friendly can with people who allow him interact with also quite the opposite unkept fall into the stereotype yuppy just don like people bothering and touching shit because they are too socially inept realize that they don have the right anything that isn theirs not socially normal pet someone animal without asking and not socially normal upset when they tell you not your right touch stuff should just let people touch baby shirt because they think cute are you going reach into backpack because there cute pen there the social ineptitude people who want just touch pet crazy ,0

hopefully didn’ sound really down bully breed kill shelter know few people who own them and they can really nice dog and the shelter talked you depth about duke and his need beforehand that’ awesome and good sign and really cutie would have guessed wa actual lab mix too but someone who had never owned dog before this and wa pretty clueless about dog behavior wa told few incorrect thing about bully breed well meaning people shelter and private rescue and just generally petfinder now kind shudder thinking about what might have happened feline best friend ’ put trust the wrong place ended with elderly pomeranian ha lot health issue but our best friend and the cutest loveliest dog know ,0

didn realize you were promoting your own blog explains the clickbait though ,0
what kind bowl the kibble ,0
well for starter lion are wild carnivorous animal dog are domesticated from wolf with the express purpose interacting with human and didn say whatever talking about petting literally the name what you pet pet which normal interaction with pet blown away some the analogy people are drawing dog not baby nor car nor lion pet domesticated from wolf specifically live among and interact with people ,0
the bowl like his safe way the food going always there long the food the bowl whenever the food put the floor think perishable and eats right away ,0
then don treat them like public property pretty simple ,0
the answer take the food away after some time longer his safe and start eating again ,0
slow feeder with little raised bump slow down his eating ,0
good thinking ,0
how having dog with treating him like public property bring anything else mine public and set down for second are you now entitled feel that public property ,0
instinctive thing for dog through they roll around something that smell interesting them mask their scent ,0
suggest trying different bowl and see eats could have aversion the current bowl for whatever reason ,0
apology for the problem you are going through there difficulty establishing causation and correlation especially with the increase grain free food rate diagnosis are staying the same despite grain free diet increasing would safe say that there isnt likely correlation however perhaps another ingredient being used more widely substitute for grain these food ,0
perfect thanks ,0
specifically live among and work for people ,0
god this make remember dog that passed away recently she instantly became weak overnight after vomiting blood and had put her down ’ awful experience but ’ better knowing that they are happy not pain and you can grieve and reminisce about all them and the wonderful memory feel for you ,0
read this with rescue dog lap beautiful and raw and powerful ,0
just don’ make all day buffet for him feed him give him hour and then take the bowl away ’ get the hang eventually ,0
fair enough the guy had ham sandwich dog probably would have stayed and never wanted leave thanks for the input just wanted make sure there wasn something wa missing ,0
wa exactly the way you are feeling now and wa devastating the time that shutdown wa volunteer fire fighting the time and couldn and job matter how hard they begged wa totally destroyed wa like that for year and even now feel lot pain some ten year later took year get another dog and now have various age will never without mate currently have one that soulmate close him young but very adventurous and worry for him and would devastated again lost him the feeling you have human nature and will not stop away but will ease have answer for you sorry other than you have bear with sorry you and your best friend have through this ,0
the point that you are repeatedly missing that someone else dog their dog pet are not public property city sidewalk not petting zoo dog being dog doe not mean you are allowed pet dog that belongs someone else ,0
wow have tear ,0
yes that too the only reason they don still work for people because there hasn been need for long time now they just social animal not work animal except maybe some very specific case ,0
and the point you missing that assigning that kind property value dog and socially isolating like that absolutely the hallmark abusive relationship and the people asked person who share your view are social recluse the type people one would interact with the street because how sketchy they are ,0
wow just wow certainly don’ deserve them ♥️ ,0
get vet they can try get her some medication help her relax and let terrier are very prey driven and jack are crazy obsessive she will need some help let this ,0
they are not social animal they are companion and work partner for their handler owner not have dog for you have dog for companion and work for one owns dog for other people ,0
your dog might picking your energy rather then the other person the fact that you know that you are going leaving your dog there might have set off some puppy alarm bell ,0
trainer sent this breeder and ha evaluated their dog aware this not typical for the breed open any breed really this just what she recommended based lifestyle and need this dog ha been raised around dog all shape and size and saw for myself trustworthy around them not must for him therapy dog just curious the realm possibility really just wanted know more about the practical aspect such what kind grooming routine for this sort dog what kind toy are the most durable etc ,0
rest assured you weren too down about them grateful hear everyone take and side especially because help partner and gauge our gut instinct bit better aww pomeranian are cuties how long have you had your oldie ,0
okay ,0
yeah ’ ask your trainer someone who ha evaluated his abnormal for the breed temperament about small dog and therapy work for gsds mals they typically have heavy coat shed about twice year with intermittent shedding between there are week that can’ pull single hair off dog and week that ’ literally drowning slicker brush great for those coat blow time between just use kong zoom groom ’ honest when dog aren’ shedding don’ brush them all then they get brushed daily when they are shedding bucket ’ big fan kong brand toy lot food stuffed kong’ nylabones are also huge hit around here there’ subscription service called bullymake box that two thoroughly enjoyed when wa having delivered ,0
sorry for your lost give dog extra pet today ,0
then don leave him unattended public ,0
they are downsizing their program after splitting way with one their trainer which why for sale yes ha the appropriate temperament one his littermates working service dog and they have extensively evaluated him and worked with him ha been alternated between kennel run tie out and inside the house hasn been worked with little while staying with the trainer refresh his house manner not newly establish them not asking for gatekeeping criticism asking for advice this sub insufferable sometimes jesus ,0
not allowed step away from something that mine ever not reasonable assumption that other people should have the self control not just touch shit ,0
think you can choose whichever breeder you want get your pup from course and you don need approval but don find moro method ethical and don find for puppy from dog being bred irresponsibly opinion rational think you could find puppy with the same qualification breeding year old breeding without titling dog being bred every heat dog smart enough open door from shelter dog litter and would more ethical feel like your mind made though regarding not exactly looking for show dog check out this link you open changing you mind there are many good reason buy from show titled parent dont want show dog don find the risk worth with moro doesn matter they usually breed health cleared dog and usually breed dog over year old and le than time breeding single dog before health clearance enough write them off responsible breeder list let alone two more dog which they done breeding dog time crazy and dangerous and breeder who doesn see anything wrong with that someone want avoid like the plague there are two other swiss shepherd breeder this side the coast that look more responsible why not check out wildwood white swiss shepherd instead over washington state faolan frost california they adhere the fci white swiss shepherd guideline which desirable and they look like they more responsible about their breeding found them this site which the fci oriented stricter swiss shepherd club america moro breeder ha invited out the kennel before and they only minute away but there need when already know don want dog from their program don really trust them anymore after seeing their lack responsible breeding ,0
awesome thank you much ,0
again not property living social animal ,0
him being public doe not change the fact that not your dog not your property not touch you shouldn need told that adult you should learn that when you ,0
maybe you should get cat ,0
did buy him pay for him live listed dog under his paper mine law also not social animal personal animal ,0
glad you enjoying your pup from moro though don feel like they put their dog care front and center breeder who care about their dog health would breed year old pup multiple occasion breed bitch time ,0
then don take him out public get cat ,0
ever see you public hope you don mind that come touch you without permission that what apparently ,0
not pet you can pet but you sure can talk any time ,0
unfortunately the ckcs problem aren really mitigated going good breeder here comment shared other reddit post the topic ckcs the past love everything about cav personality and look would get one heartbeat weren for the health problem crazy their health problem are truly pervasive the breed recent year longitudinal study 1000 ckcs study showed 100 the breed ha chiari skull malformation that developed into syringomyelia the time ckcs with severe warning video ha cry dog and might upsetting terrible and totally unrelated the skull stuff literally 100 ckcs develop mitral valve heart disease and experience mvd related heart failure they age heart failure kill almost half them before age the breed club used recommend breeding protocol that responsible breeder were not breed dog with murmur before age but they eventually scrapped entirely because wasn effective feasible htm september 2010 they such cute sweet and lovely little dog other regard but the health problem that have become pervasive the breed are nothing short tragic ,0
that make sense wa expecting him shed more but his coat pretty short and didn seem shed much while wa there how often you find you need bathe them give pancake bath once week after going the barn before visit whichever come first the zoom groom work better than the mitten noted about kong sure get one those always buying nylabones already lol ,0
dog were going public every day they would get bathed more often than they right now you’ probably fine with once twice month though barring activity that get them super gross just recently got the grooming mitt and they work great too just about the same the zoom groom but cover more surface area ,0
thank you much dog reactive and sniffing really soothing for her think she like ,0
don blame you that nice that will have le work the grooming department one le favorite part owning dog prefer the fun stuff like training exercise than nail clipping and such will order the mitt and slicker ,0
got one those for boxer lab mix because would get the foulest smelling gas from eating too fast the first time have him picked from the kitchen floor carried into the living room and dumped foot then gulped down all the food two bite damn miss that smart as dog ,0
obsessive compulsive disorder dog usually require both medication and behavior modification for best result you should really consult veterinary behaviorist this one condition that get worse you don treat and can significantly impact your dog quality life don delay and destroy the laser pointer and put everyone notice that under condition should they ever use such device with this any other dog ever again not cute and not funny ,0
yep consider dogs’ coat pretty low maintenance you can get higher maintenance with low coat gsds but doesn’ sound like you’ have that problem good luck ,0
not sure how much enough but yeah spend time training her ,0
’ not cry you’ cry ,0
this ha tear rest well puppers you were loved ,0
what you buy one those mouse for cat that roll and make her think she caught the mouse ,0
that what thinking just make her think she caught but also feel like that would embooden her try and catch more ,0
could ptsd symptom rescue dog took about month before wa able pet him all did his term did not try force compel him accept touch had him for almost year now and still reactive being approached people with whom not familiar but doe allow people pet him once used them however anyone other than myself can only pet him for few second time before reacts even when approach them his own never bite but freak out and act aggressive manner ha always had episode ptsd where will dozing off and suddenly jump and start yelping being attacked take few second for him realize where and that all okay then settle back down being put cbd oil schedule ha helped lessen the frequency these episode now ha some day with this not happening all just don touch him when laying down even awake ,0
how wa she diagnosed without cardiologist ,0
you should have shown her the dead mouse and slow her sniff that still your best bet cause she can still smell where the mouse used live and doesn know gone ,0
who know these study are all new ’ really hard tell she doe show sign improvement though after this diet change and treatment ’ going share her experience and info with any vet school research center that want ,0
she had echo exam done today and they saw her dilated left ventricle ,0
well cried ,0
not stalkerish all think totally fun and normal pay close attention dog fascinating try understand how another specie see the world and her emerging personality will interesting too hate even mention but two dog together hugely fascinating ,0
use filtered water add apple cider vinegar his drinking water ,0
the low battery beep the smoke alarm dog hell earth ,0
thank you ’ sure look into that area ,0
make sure you are washing everything pup touch went through two round giardia panacur plus antibiotic and washed basically everything couch floor harness collar leash toy bowl after every meal wa lot but worked also ’ worth noting that many adult dog with giardia are asymptomatic your pup testing positive but not showing symptom you don’ necessarily need treat talk your vet see what they advise that the case ,0
what other thing you with her you have very intelligent very high hunting drive terrier what you work that brain ,0
fiore mal love the zoom groom doe pretty good job pulling out the loose hair when she shedding she pretty low shed overall but comparing her german shedder who think shedding year round gig and aim fill the vacuum canister ,0
that sound like pretty severe case have you talked your vet about this would get recommendation for behaviorist seems like you tried numerous thing without result think getting expert would very helpful shock collar not going help but will likely just agitate him basically the car give him excitement and you were shock for being excited you will just create frustrated and confused dog very likely will back fire for now would try limit exposure much possible sound like the behavior pretty set still the more get the more settle have heard these sticky layer that you can cover window ’ not actually glued but just adheres make the glass cloudy the dog can’ see through would that prevent him from seeing the car how doe his exercise regimen look like sound like found himself job the absence enough mental stimulation can you add additional training session just teach trick and maybe add some off leash time where there aren’ any car around maybe you can teach him fetch playing frisbee ,0
often mask it scent prey can sense coming ,0
your dog giving any indication that upset stressed panicked scared etc mean you telling everything you doing which bit extreme but nothing about what the dog doing which give immediate impression that you are bothered and stressed this not the dog ,0
second what synaxis said ,0
why not just stop trying pet the dog and certainly wouldn try pet him when dozing off mean not all dog enjoy petting the first place and experience even dog that enjoy petting have strong preference about who pet them and what circumstance since petting ostensibly for the dog enjoyment there point forcing the issue also three week isn very long time take everything kind slowly and let the dog set the pace for non necessary stuff already following you around the house and seeming generally happy that great whether the dog wa abused— maybe but more likely wasn socialized well puppy and isn used whole lot contact ,0
would just use children’ adult diaper depending how big she and secure them under pair extra large panty case she try chew them off just make sure cut hole for her tail ,0
who performed the echo typically animal they are only done specialist ,0
heard everything from boredom and anxiety itchy tongue love know what specific because dog ha just started doing this from time time ,0
sound like you have more than one mouse your house terrier hunting dog the terrier see mouse which trigger it prey drive the terrier know the scent mouse and could likely hear them the time the terrier go insane likely time when the terrier hears smell mouse your house time bring exterminator evaluate the home ,0
there likely more mouse and around the house ,0
that wa big cry for ,0
love this much cried did glad you found each other this lifetime ,0
thanks for the suggestion the diaper dont fall apart when you cut into them ,0
might try keeping her 5ft radius all time often possible continue love her use treat she food driven enough even use her regular dog food she for you need let her know you are her people she can trust you she safe with you not trainer but it trust issue and submissive tendency she scared and think she will hurt ,0
best luck doggie look like sweetie ,0
this morning when the drilling started woke panicking and screaming scratching took him out and when the drilling started back our block his tail went right down and tried crouch run when the drilling going panic mode doesn listen and ha tried bolt out the door whenever open and lick his lip lot normally only go the door the leash when the drilling wa it worst took him out because heard him screaming from another floor which normally doesn and even when tried walk him wa still shaking and trying curl the floor several time also normally hyperstimulated vet and trainer have noted this when just normal construction doesn really seem care but when the drilling start bit different know that stressed this just don want overlook stressed well ,0

scent rolling conserved wolf behavior not certain why wolf but some research suggests way carry important scent information back the pack pat goodmann research associate and curator wolf park indiana spent several year studying the phenomenon called scent rolling the wolf their semi natural wolf reserve “scent rolling probably way for wolf bring information back the pack ” said goodmann “when wolf encounter novel odor first sniff and then roll getting the scent it body especially around the face and neck upon it return the pack greets and during the greeting investigates the scent thoroughly wolf park observed several instance where one more pack member ha then followed the scent directly back it origin ” this scent smearing ritual isn limited stinky odor her study goodmann placed different odor the wolf enclosure and found that wolf roll sweet smelling scent too besides rolling ode cat elk mouse and hog they also rolled mint extract chanel halt dog repellant fish sandwich with tartar sauce fly repellent and old spice the scent aren necessarily foul nor are they one that wolf necessarily like goodmann stated “some the wolf park wolf object when handler put fly repellent their ear tip but these same wolf often scent roll readily fly repellent manufactured sprayed onto horse provided the scent are sprayed the ground and left for the wolf discover ” ,0

are you comfortable with cross any the breed you listed little genetic diversity usually make for healthier dog not make sure you see the vet record for both parent the dog maltese are great dog and very funny and active but can independent and cat like sometimes grew with two aunty owning shih tzus and they fit every box your list well being very intelligent and incredibly long lived favorite one aunt owned lived into his twenty and knew how pick his own toy and put them away the toy box command they’ also not usually yappy the way many small breed can you aren’ looking spend lot money but also don’ want through shelter you can look breed specific rescue lot the breed you listed are popular among elderly people and sometimes young purebred dog end private rescue when their owner pas away our last dog wa rescue who had been raised elderly people and she wa the most well behaved well socialized and loving dog ’ ever met getting adult dog also mean you know exactly what their personality like because they’ fully grown ,0

lost dog and best friend few month ago this made cry much had take break read this reminded how devastated wa lose him but also how happy have had him thank you ,0
not poor animal ownership give the dog much interaction and exercise possible not special condition ask someone before petting their dog basic that you think someone else pet free for all for petting weird the job pet not entertain randoms who think they get pet any strange dog they see perfectly reasonable take leashed dog out public and expect people say hey cool pet him first even you leave while you get coffee don generally because creep but really that doesn make other people fault for not they weren asking for ,0
’ mutt have idea ,0

there alternative toy maybe mechanical that you can introduce distract her from mouse hunting terrier are hugely intelligent breed and have the tendency fixate perceived prey and just not let which would wonderful your family were under threat laser rodent but not great otherwise the key try redirect their natural inclination obsessively hunt burrow dig target your choosing maybe consult research professional canine behaviourist this make you not want keep her ,0
great suggestion don think the film will help too much closing the curtain did nothing besides make him focus more see through them have large fenced yard will make point exercise him more with game too bad degree outside and our other dog play really well and involves lot chasing around the backyard and wrestling which wear them both out pretty well will also work trick more his brain will calm down working kiss right now see how this work and then look into behaviorist have feeling end that route ,0
yeah agreed there’ pretty much such thing “one mouse the house ” ,0
have labrador apartment and work really well just make sure get regular exercise will say lab are short coated and don shed much other breed especially those like shepherd aussie etc just brush them out regularly and you good only terrible the spring and couple week fall when they blowing out their coat you concerned about how much lab shed poodle might honestly something look into not doodle poodle mix they are coat maintenance disaster and can also shed though they tend more vocal and don match personality wise what you want much there reason breed like lab and goldens are popular and because they very adaptable companion lifestyle ,0
you probably have mouse where there’ one mouse there are more your terrier probably able smell and hear them and just trying good terrier ’ find dog safe way address your mouse problem also throw away the laser pointer ,0
you put their kennel the play pen assume that what you mean fence that should fine just make sure you line the area with many piddle pad the kennel will make the puppy feel safer than just the play pen ,0

hasn’ had general check while might inclined schedule one this week maybe the puking will stop and not big deal you can always cancel appointment might nice get bloodwork panel for your dog his age and good baseline check regardless vomiting though ,0
glad hear this may ask what insurance company ,0
healthy paw ,0
his last check wa about month ago and everything came back normal actually went the emergency vet about week ago induce vomiting because ate some string and they dis check there well though not full blood panel ,0
that’ great hope she feeling better ♥️ ,0

well thank you for the feedback and taking the time read through everything wrote would interested hearing your thought about what should doing with sammy training wise mostly you think should trying condition his guarding that not something our trainer ha mentioned something should doing would welcome any info how proceed know that this not something that can cured term immediate fix but want hear that can get point where can trust sammy around other people without worrying that will hurt someone also just struggling with partner and our trainer saying that sammy can eventually fit into our life don understand why they are optimistic about feel like they are not impacted the event and doubting myself whether treating this too seriously are these behavior reasonable ground for making the decision give him back the rescue folk doe help just hear someone else say that this behavior very serious ,0
know all about that extreme zoomies throwing toy the air barking said toy barking and “dancing” around treat hope you are enjoying having her your life ☺️ ,0
definitely vet could just bad dream seizure even doggie dementia but her age vet trip warranted and happens again try get video show the vet ,0

not sure your vet mentioned but protein allergy typically mean they can have the fat from that animal food like pro plan sensitive skin and stomach should fine because the only chicken chicken fat that said severe enough allergy that small trace protein the chicken fat can set off then your dog can have issue from any food that made the same factory chicken based food due cross contamination like how some people allergic peanut can even eat regular mm because they were produced factory that ha peanut that the case you might want try description diet however would also ask there prescription diet that could help with the dcm ,0

have the same issue and found very good dog sitter care com let the dog out day when not there you out lot night would probably not good fit but you are homebody when you are not working then yeah get dog two ,0
don’ get rid him get him his own bed and make him sleep every night most dog won’ soil their own bed ,0
tried that for about year and either destroyed the bed peed his cage mostly happens his sleep ,0
have you tried doggie diaper ,0
chihuahua russel terrier mix the same way with cat ’ basically had stop allowing them play fight even friendly way when notice ’ getting rough with her ’ bring out toy bone and distract him with something ’ allowed they play le and le but can tell cat more relaxed and dog ha become slightly le territorial about the bed night ,0
how would the dog the bathroom ,0
she look samoyed but from talking few people they think she too small one month around pound how big will she grown you think guess around lb which would the small side for female samoyed but not abnormally since she rescue from china odds are good she not well bred dog which could why she not completely standard based the picture and her size think far more likely she samoyed possibly mixed with something else than japanese spitz japanese spitz typically top out around lb she already bigger than spitz should she ha not started her shedding that normal yes that normal she still ha her puppy coat and puppy coat typically don shed the shedding will start once she get her adult coat usually happens sometime around month age understand that samoyed shed decent amount but spitz not both breed shed metric fuckton the spitz breed including both samoyed and japanese spitz are some the heaviest shedding dog existence can tell just looking the picture that this dog will shed and will likely shed lot but how often would brushing she wa samoyed aim for least once week more frequently you not want constant white tumbleweed around your house when she blowing her coat you will probably need brush daily make sure you brush all the way down the skin with undercoat rake her coat doesn get matted ,0
didn know that wa thing cant believe might have get them for year old dog jesus ,0
dog going shed usually start when they lose their puppy coat and get their adult coat that typically around month but can vary from dog dog ,0
that would definitely cause pup wild grandparent have old farm house with farm dog who hunt down all the rodent she go nut she smell one and can find ,0
hailcorporate just kidding getting new puppy this week and after previous experience definitely going with pet insurance ,0
doesn make sense aunt recently had put her 15y dog and muzzle you were there through the process not ever get that your love cuddled his heart sorry for your loss ,0
you right that much too long for dog alone every single day ,0
hour alone daily awfully long time expect dog alone most dog can handle hour but any longer than that regular basis imo getting into neglect territory you might able make work you can come home everyday around lunch time hire dog walker just keep mind that dog walker can get expensive you use them frequently cost vary depending where you live but per walk seems pretty typical you need dog walker every day monday through friday you looking 400 month ,0
need see vet young dog shouldn incontinent like that there very good chance there some kind underlying issue ,0
dumb and never considered until about minute ago calling the vet once they open ,0
exactly you also don know where dog started and how much progress ha been made maybe that dog across the street staring you and not listening his owner say sit poorly trained maybe used lunge and bark these kind situation and the behavior you seeing now huge improvement that his owner worked very hard achieve ,0
that explains why she’ been fine with food that ha chicken fat the ingredient list just assumed wa because wa such small amount that wasn’ bothering her put her hill’ with duck based protein along with some taurine supplement knowing that information though will definitely keep mind with future dog wish had understood that better few month ago thank you for the info ,0
usually make our own broth winter least once week and add some veggie give flavor with onion too then remove all the veggie and filter the liquid but more le liter broth the onion practically absent sometimes give him bit with his kibble and love ,0

had put down malamute last week she wa only year old the muzzle just for the vet safety the dog panic and lash out the vet even though you know your dog the vet don know your dog like you yes dog wa also nervous with the muzzle but rather not have her bite the vet right before have put her down because her panicking from the shot she get know exactly how you feel malamute died right arm being very confused and afraid but you can blame vet for trying protect himself even though you know they love animal just much you very sorry for your loss but try not focus the last few moment and remember the good time you had with your dog ,0
think bernese would great fit big cuddly and fluffy but fairly lazy and easy going the other hand your requirement also fit huge portion older shelter dog probably worth going and seeing what your locale rescue have ,0
just use one those high pile bathmats seen people make really cute one out fleece but not have time for that kind art and craft project haha ,0
are you ready hire mid day help dog walker daycare figure about 300 month depending your area are you willing devote significant amount your free time the care and companionship your dog forego social opportunity sure your dog need are met not that can done but expensive and requires high level commitment ,0
what breed type dog are you interested and why lab goldern retriever corgi hard find breeder koolies beagle mareamma very open cross breed looking your answer firstly absolutely cross the mareamma and any other lgd their cross off your list they have strong instinct territorial wary stranger dog human and generally not very biddable socialization will help the dog more polite but will not erase these instinct beagle are nice guy but tend towards noisy and not great off leash all when beagle find scent and finding scent beagle favorite pastime that scent becomes their own world and they will follow wherever may totally deaf their owner call ,0
definitely take the pup the vet mine and from the day got her she ha done this bladder issue due her tiny size diagnosed vet she wear diaper around the house ,0
plan though dont think it the bladder size hopefully something can get figured out ,0
create high climbing route and resting place for the cat that can easily get out the dog reach and hang out the same room without interacting google catify catification for idea interrupt chasing and redirect the dog feed the animal separate room with closed door between them reward the dog for calm behavior the cat presence also consider crating the dog bedtime that the cat can have sole access the bed and you overnight ,0
may have bladder issue regardless the reason pup pomeranian and lb soaking wet make sense her bladder issue size defect related your pup may have had birth defect something generally wrong with his bladder kidney hopefully you find out what sure love you and want stay with you ,0
the article you cite includes this caution adding vinegar drinking water “people often talk about adding acv water bowl ” say canine health researcher mary straus “ feeling that you should also offer plain water just case your dog don’ want drink the apple cider vinegar water you wouldn’ want risk their drinking le water and possibly becoming dehydrated ” ,0
sound like some kind incontinence and your vet should able help you with that ,0
really think that’ not enough time even you got dog walker come mid day you would need how much time could you actually spend with your dog after returning home 8pm you’ have max awake time with the dog but including life stuff like showering running errand etc sound like you’ awake and interacting with your dog for hour day that’ not enough ’ afraid ,0
agree with this hour pushing cruel unless they have access outside pee and poo you decide get dog walker have two dog with doggie door they can get outside ,0
china and the far east large percentage the native dog are landrace have been there all along spitz and absolutely possible and may probably that this dog mix even pure local dog understand that samoyed shed decent amount but spitz not but how often would brushing she wa samoyed your information wrong all spitz shed like their job course the total volume will different from huge malamute tiny pomeranian and worse when they are blowing their undercoat twice year but they all shed and japanese spitz would require regular brushing you own either breed and wear black clothing invest lint roller ,0
it truly terrible thing through our dog who wa diagnosed with kidney disease over year ago now and wa also given month year had his system flushed and since then ha been renal diet and that ha fought hard but feel coming the end his battle recently switched him royal canin because apparently it more palatable seems like lot more wa constant battle try and get him eat hill good luck and hope you are given many more year like were lucky enough x200b ,0
done and over with why are you worried about the law this point doubt you actually planning suing him because you were you speaking lawyer and not dog sound like you just looking for reason outraged stop you just lost family member you should spending more time mourning him and le time worrying about petty bullshit ,0
what you put him diaper little bit old and may not able control himself anymore ,0
have you had vet visit discus these concern there could medical reason for the incontinence that you need address before looking training ,0
hire someone will first need someone can trust the area have access home not something can commit right now that not something can afford though regarding free time yes once home can devote time for care and companionship with the dog going for walk dog park and entertain home especially the weekend don want have dog just for the sake having dog want companion and more than willing put the time ,0
your dog should seen your vet within few day bringing him home that would great time ask these question ,0
don out lot night and even not for very long regarding two dog will that reduce the mental burden off when they are alone having partner crime will make them both more happy ,0
that part the issue people commented getting dog sitter walker but that will require that find someone can trust ,0
your welcome glad help didn think the time but you could also see you could foster dog typically the rescue will pay for any vet care good etc for the dog and temporary commitment ,0
pup tend have minimal shedding until they get rid their puppy coat grow their adult one that tends happen around the first birthday however the time year also influence and would add give take month that one year mark alfie hardly shed single hair until wa month old and then bam looked like someone exploded collie inside house ,0
doubt can get home from work every day launch will take minute not long but still each direction which will basically cut own time the office and start issue work can afford dog sitter but since live apartment will need someone can trust with the key house ,0

people seek closure losing pet traumatic wasn expecting that and had spend her last moment with her dog stressed out can totally understand the anger and can totally understand why she seeking clarity the issue isn because she choosing mad instead grieving because she grieving anger bargaining all part normal grieving process ounce compassion go long way and horrible that you would judge her and jump such wild conclusion her moment pain just because she processing way that you don feel correct ,0

work animal shelter and have had fair share working with fearful dog literally almost everyday haven read any the other comment someone may have already suggested this but here how work with them find very special tasty treat often try piece roast chicken cheese imitation crab you get the idea this treat only for the touch command start tossing the treat from distance and having the dog approach can stress enough how important for this the dog term keep min and end positive note they all have their limit take patience and perseverance get them the point where they take from your hand once they are taking from your hand you can now use the touch command say touch they take treat and make body contact eventually the dog associate the word touch and the physical touch with positive reward and you can work touching the dog with one hand and rewarding them with the other some other tip are don crowd the dog always let them come you use appeasing body language crouched down your knee body sideward the dog and avoid direct eye contact use high voice with soft praising word ,0

yes you should have asked just because dog public doesn mean there for anyone pet may come off crabby but many time seen people enthusiasm overwhelms their common sense and understanding dog body language and come the conclusion that the more the person say dog love the more they are about getting their dog petting fix than the dog enjoying the experience honest most dog don really love stranger handling them specially without their owner around there real problem with reactive dog and imho some them are not really all that reactive they just want their god damn walk without stranger getting into their business this doubly they are tied outside alfie awesome and sweet and because this the world petting zoo attitude would never tie him outside store ,0

wonder something got lost translation back when the parent breed mix were determined another possibility that the parent were more mixed than thought seen many time when parent breed are rounded golden mix called golden poodle cross called poodle and forth she look somewhat houndish and some way bit like doberman but don think she she ha very long nose lean body and rather refined bone structure that aligns with poodle however poodle supposed only her makeup acds heelers are short stocky and rather robust build and hard imagine she half acd heeler lab and acds heelers have short coat but with definite undercoat and not short fine and close fitting hers can see the white marking very clearly they have fleck color them when multiple breed are mixed sometimes you can get unexpected result but she far enough off what would expected that still question lizzy look very very sweet and demure lady ,0
good luck have much admiration for people who adopt fearful animal and want put the effort help them live better life ,0

have two thing say about this that maybe are worth considering you absolutely should not make any decision based any roommate girlfriend’ potential availability really shouldn’ factor your thinking sure could turn out dream situation however take long hard look all the roommate situation where roommate have resented this dog that they suddenly have obligation care for maybe they won’ care for your dog with the same attention and care you worse maybe they will deeply bond with them and you’ move year uprooting the dog from her pack second time short period that stuff isn’ just possible happens all the time and there are hundred other permutation but you should way assume your roommate should assume the labor care your dog ’ sure your uncle provins good care but truly she’ your dog you also have the right seek it companionship yes you’ separating her you need prepared take the full responsibility her but you can provide that home now your choice ,0

talk the vet about how much you should feeding her for her weight and activity level hopefully they can direct you some good food for her that isn’ too expensive well also make sure her teeth get cleaned may not important while she pup but when she older can definitely prolong her life she ha rotten tooth could cause sepsis and isn’ caught fast enough could fatal always give the purina version the dentastix them seem the only one that work well and they get their teeth cleaned the vet once year part the banfield petsmart plan you pay set amount every month and then office visit are free and you get twice year comprehensive exam just something check out the petsmart the area good typically save about 200 year per dog other than that always give lot love and have lot patience congrats and she cutie ,0
embark actually much more accurate than either those someone can swing the larger price tag ,0

tip when reaching pet him reach low not over his head ,0
dog ha flea allergy can take while clear even they not being bit anymore since the environment very well could still have flea though she might still getting bitten slower recovery unfortunately lot area frontline doesn work very well anymore because the flea have developed resistance the main ingredient probable that why you roommate dog still had such large amount flea did you ask your vet about benadryl usually totally safe for dog and could help with the itching while her skin heals and you continue cleaning the house ,0
rescued puppy mill boy with same issue actually had back scratcher that would pull out got him the point the bed too and would lay down let him sniff and then pick and lightly scratch him with think did two thing felt good him and knew were touching him and learned trust finally just crawled one night and that wa now sleep spooning lol you get this just take time ,0
that case definitely recommend not giving him access food put down for min and then take away regardless how much eaten the article go more depth also make much easier for you track his appetite which often the quickest way tell your dog ill ,0
’ had lot people tell that think ’ rhodesian because the dark ridge his back for your response ,0
agree ,0
the people who are telling you you awful for taking the dog back are misplacing blame the people responsible for the fact that she wa the shelter begin with are her previous owner and before that whoever wa responsible for bringing her into the world intentionally through negligence and the people who put you the position unknowingly acquiring dog that wa not what you wanted companion animal are blame for the fact that you are even considering the return you want take her back that your call you are correct that senior dog have higher likelihood incurring expense the near future and that may emotionally difficult dumping senior dog that you have owned for period time because these issue shit being unwilling take these thing dog that you have prior commitment not adopting great but you going adopt dog you should also get animal that you are prepared care for senior dog deserve love yes but you not deserve unwittingly burdened end life care when that not what you signed for trying shame people into taking animal with issue that they aren prepared handle wrong and how you turn people off adoption entirely though adopting senior dog great you are not obligated have dog all not obligated adopt and not obligated adopt this specific dog you choose keep this dog you doing great thing for this animal who may difficult adopt out otherwise you don keep her you not doing anything wrong and you need consider what going make you happy well because both people and dog happiness and well being matter ,0

’ sorry for what you’ going through and won’ pretend know first dog passed someone else’ care while wa living another country and ’ sure once dog pass girlfriend and will very similar you know for uncle his first dog wa his last dog because went through similar experience you knew other dog would the same but cherishes the time did have with her she wa his one dog and they had the time their life together your friend probably have never heard people doing this the puppy with elderly dog thing common because the pain immense they want distract themselves for reaction them would politely yet firmly ask “have you gone through this before not don’ really want advice welcome from those who’ been through hard time but those who haven’ are making this harder for right now ” and just keep that stock answer whatever you make eventually they’ hopefully stop you sound like wonderful owner and ’ sure you’ dog know all the love you give them ’ sorry for your loss ,0
sorry think people who haven’ bonded with dog like you have will never understand that you are going through highest level grief you have the opportunity grief counseling because that may help one even people close you can tell you how feel deal right now wouldn’ try replace him but maybe you can volunteer shelter rescue help save other dog just lift your spirit and theirs ,0
iirc more about the temperature the compost than length time properly kill bacteria and other pathogen you \ want\ killed you need higher temperature than usual composting can usually not worth try and compost human pet waste ,0
guess some sort cur mixed with bbm are you the southern state ,0
sorry you going through this heartbreaking time just love the little one and all you can for him sadly our dog get sick too and don live much longer life other dog will replace him the bond you share will never broken keep him your heart remember the happy time and will feel better ,0
people have certain expectation about how you supposed grieve fuck them what work for you you don feel like you should get puppy right now then getting puppy would mistake they lot work and stress the best time and while that may what some people need focus when they lose older dog that doesn mean you have the same losing someone close you hurt matter what their specie not something that stop hurting but something you gradually get better dealing with don let anyone rush you along with what they think appropriate schedule coping ,0
losing family furry otherwise about appreciating the time you had together and letting the good memory anchor you you were both very lucky have found each other time you start living with the love not the loss sending hug ,0
wa understood that you would taking this dog back sound like your uncle attached and want keep her ,0
this just one small area example spread through most the apartment except for one bedroom ,0
why doe the dog have alone ,0
happy around him and cry when you are away you can sad you want for long you want more than dog your family your friend and companion soon will the best guardian angel you could imagine ignore what others say this something you only understand once you have been through yourself lost greatest friend when wa cancer time with him wa ripped away from biggest price advice always kiss your dog goodnight ,0
most dog know who are apoquel long term get regular blood work that seems fine cytopoint shot increasingly popular alternative that you should look into you are concerned while there are risk associated with both these treatment many dog tolerate them very well and the end the day the alternative the dog being itchy all day every day and scratching itself piece the relatively small risk adverse side effect seems tolerable— anyway ,0
seems mixed bag for sure just don get why someone would have pet that social nature and them lose when the animal socializes ,0
time that’ all you can let time heal your heart ’ been your shoe and felt exactly the same way the only way heal thru good luck you sound like you and your pup were lucky have each other ,0
because are not home all the time ha our dog play with and they are friend but just won’ stop barking because want human attention ,0
btw give her lot attention when are home ’ just when ’ not ,0
this right here friend and were nonchalant about “just get another puppy” when thinking about this kind situation then each got our own first puppy few year ago and now ’ like “’ not sure could stomach ” ,0
pretty not cool that dog tied outside the expectation for him sitting there and waiting for not interacting with people can anything not interact when tied can get away have yelled people for trying pet dog when tied because working hard ignore all the other distraction car and other dog and people walking shouldn have have someone his face while trying maintain his down for minute while getting coffee also shouldn have put sign telling you not touch him not public property ,0
’ sorry you’ going through this can’ imagine the pain everyone deserves able grieve their own way people are trying help and make you feel better and don’ realize ’ hurting you all you can about that ignore one thing can suggest best friend recently had put down her sick dog after year and the only thing she keep saying she regret not making one those paw print keepsake him those kit with clay that you make their paw print know that’ the least your concern right now but just had make the suggestion because know how much friend regret not having such special keepsake her dodger give him all the love you have give ha had wonderful life with you seems best wish ,0
mine apoquel and vet ha told that while haven exhausted all option quite yet likely that apoquel will the best permanent treatment haven experienced any side effect mine ha been apoquel for year also say that allergy testing isn all foolproof careful thinking that last ditch but conclusive test food allergy test are really unreliable and while environmental allergy test are better that doesn mean you can eliminate the allergent altogether and the expensive custom made allergy med aren all that reliable either ,0
someone with puppy this pretty common don’ think ’ your dog problem fault the reason act this way because puppy have manner and general behave ‘rudely’ towards other dog trying tell the puppy ‘nock off’ and that how puppy learn from other dog also probably scary for your dog because small and bigger puppy could hurt him without really meaning all you can really supervise him and teach him stay away from puppy while ’ the puppy owner who responsible for telling the puppy calm down and leave him alone ,0
thanks rationally know likely see the right dog some day just like found him and knew wa mine ,0
’ awful you need take much time you need but when you get new dog you are never replacing your past dog nothing can you are simply helping fill what you are missing you said your dog helped you through much when that’ gone something missing getting new dog help fill what your missing and maybe even wherever your dog would getting new dog would make happy know your happy and not sad but that said let the grieving cycle take ’ course one should rush you ,0
thanks that also concern about the allergy testing cost 800 and run the risk the result saying allergic whatever suspect waste money good know that your little one isn showing any side effect after year ,0
thanks much ,0
not ,0
get chuck and get your local dog park they super smart and need thing have fun ,0
don’ get german shepherd you can’ handle shedding they’ fur monster with short hair coat would suggest greyhound they’ very kind dog they’ called the world fastest couch potato and don’ need much exercise german shepherd all the one ’ met are super kind and sweet and very gentle they’ very good dog ,0
hmm lessens the chance that kind mix probably but that still vote based the puppy look ,0
pretty off his rocker you have pretty dumb tie your animal outside leave around other human and expect one interact with people love dog they try pet them decided leave his dog where someone could grab they want would never this live big city and find irresponsible people can crazy and dog stealing for fighting and breeding real and happens all the time might seem bad mannered but tying dog outside mindless ,0
these people haven gone through and understand the glow new puppy brings some people actually mean well because crazy dog lady and without dog seems unfathomable the more sensitive people say stuff like awesome wa because you and similar sentiment being great dog owner thank you for that ,0
definitely interested grief counselling done therapy before and really help cathartic way thanks for the support ,0
good insight take experiencing really understand how new puppy would just leave that wound open need process ,0
this one ,0
exactly while cherish the early year wa very diligent training boy and wasn easy all but paid off immensely not place where can handle that kind commitment ,0
you grieve way that right for you x200b when lost first dog when wa swore and down that would never get another dog would get mad parent they brought getting dog few year later fell love with neighbor dog they ended giving him they didn really have the time for him and wanted focus breeding their purebred x200b x200b that dog died suddenly when wa early wa devastated but the house wa too quite without dog and knew boy would want give another dog home about month after passed ended rescuing puppy x200b x200b saw this poem awhile back and ha always touched x200b before human die they write their last will and testament giving their home and all they have those they leave behind with paw could the same this what ’ ask… poor and lonely stray ’ give happy home bowl and cozy bed soft pillow and all toy the lap which loved much the hand that stroked fur and the sweet voice that spoke name ’ will the sad scared shelter dog the place had human’ loving heart which there seemed bound when die please not say “ will never have pet again for the loss and the pain more than can stand ” instead find unloved dog one whose life ha held joy hope and give place him this the only thing can give… the love left behind – author unknown x200b ,0
thank you for this ,0
you know your time with your dog coming end and that tremendously sad had euthanize pup and there nothing easy about but you are dog person who will always want dog your life you will have many dog your lifetime never make the loss one dog easier but the back your mind you know there will more some day because that who you are and you look forward finding and meeting and loving those new animal and that can very comforting thought ,0
not the main problem you asking about but chasing him around harness him sound kinda scary for him have you tried teaching him come you for getting his harness put since willingly eat treat you could try teach him hand target super easy teach essentially reward for touching his nose your hand x200b building off that combined hand target with the dog going underneath other hand reach the target essentially petting themselves with hand found that stationary and allow the dog engage disengage with being pet that make them feel more comfortable over all like they know you not reaching for them chasing them and that they can end the interaction when they done ,0
man too early friend ours lost their dog recently cancer one day wa fine week later they found out wa riddled with cancer she wa pregnant and wa breaking down her baby shower the bathroom wa right around when mine started decline kiss him and tell him the best thing happen every day ,0
thank you much for that suggestion used silly thing with card where stamp his paw washable ink and sign this perfect wa thinking putting his collar and tag shadow box and this would perfect addition for the centre ,0
some thing done with anxious but friendly dog are lay down their bed and coax them over sit cross legged the floor with one their toy treat and just play with until they get interested then kinda see they will climb into your lap and that way they are initiating their own pace have dog that seems scared getting kicked but love cuddle took while with him hopping bed with you but then instantly taking off you even flich but now hop his own and realises that just because breath doesnt mean gonna get kicked been sweet seeing him warm the last few year ,0
you you honestly some people shouldn’ even giving advice ignore the stupid shit and get with your life there for your dog all the way the end they will appreciate that grieve ’ good for your soul know sound cliche but you will alright could tell you story but won’ take comfort the fact that you loved and were loved you can’ replace that and you shouldn’ someday you will love again and you will truly appreciate that good luck friend ,0
yes they are fantastic this the first one ’ owned turn february and still like young spring chicken but you’ right about the enthusiasm and the off switch can quite the cuddle bug well ’ owned other terrier but none are like rat terrier ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ ,0
you’ never get over the loss dog especially one you’ had while you grew and helped get you through tough time getting new puppy will fill the void for the time being and definitely better than having empty house lost childhood dog when wa 10yrs old 2013 cancer got new puppy few month later because couldn’ stand the quietness the house without dog now have wonderful dog look after but occasionally will still have good cry missing original buddy get easier over time but unfortunately two dog will the same you just need make the most the time you have with them and cherish their memory under circumstance would advise get puppy while your dog still alive introducing new puppy their life could put him over the edge would wait out and see how you feel when your dog eventually pass ’ brutal first but few month empty house help put thing back into perspective new puppy could never replace the bond you had with you dog but might help soothe the pain ,0
lock them out your room but seriously ,0

cbd could possibly help both issue believe helped our dog anxiety and since being she also tends inhale her food like never before don know the cbd really ha anything with the eating but could worth try ,0
the biggest risk will surgery but personally don think year will have negative effect you all the pre surgery test bloodwork something you might want discus with your vet spay incontinence which typically treatable but will never just away wonder ovarian sparing spay would better option she would still get false pregnancy ,0

thing like this make nervous have very reactive dog and always keep her leash anytime she’ outside but many people our neighborhood will let their dog outside their fenced yard unrestrained keep enough distance between dog and the strange dog dog will usually behave but the other dog decided run for some reason for example were too close the other dog and dog started barking and the other dog got territorial dog would not hesitate defend herself and and fear for what would happen her after situation like that especially because she’ pitty ,0

think you like most people who write this sort thing mean nice and avoid controversy singling out dog that lack good recall training the issue though not training but temperament when dog aggressive and violent that should lose any chance being loose grew place and time without much emphasis leash law and the dog who were loose ignored their owner recall command but they didn around attacking anyone people always overestimate how well trained their dog are most are aware that their biter biter see this guy the other dog’ owner did nothing help remove discipline his dog sound like scared his own doggie nice sorry that happened you ,0
that what thought from everything read but our vet saying she need stay nexguard for life ,0

great well behaved normal pet dog who homeless and shelter setting will make brief eye contact will want make soft gentle physical contact will yearn make any contact all they want person they craving companionship they want bond with human dog who flinch away shy away simply avoid your gaze and your touch are tough dog don let shelter worker smilingly tell you they just need quiet home relax dog show you who they are the shelter setting hyper dog doesn get significantly le hyper indifferent dog doesn warm much ,0
spay incontinence would major concern that can range from mild very difficult deal with dog that size can live for well over year how would you feel about year incontinent dog weight gain doe happen spays are harder mature dog are any major surgery have you considered ovariectomy that smaller surgery they remove the ovary and leave the uterus alternative not trying sway you just putting out there negative effect ,0

interesting point about the bone marrow will have look that ,0
thanks lot missed the first comment thanks for taking the time comment again appreciate the head spay incontinence something worried about that being the case would you still recommend spaying ,0
maybe miscommunication usually adult dog dog over about month with functioning immune system they don really much definitely double check what they meant when you talk them next ,0
thank you for the info ,0
thanks most likely projecting feeling onto her haha she still seems very anxious let into their room after she been out for walk though that just natural response the sound their cry she sit the door and whine until let her maybe once they gone she calm down well ,0
thanks for your comment think all dog without solid recall should leashed regardless temperament when friendly dog approach reactive dog leash can understandably make the leashed dog nervous and more likely lash out just because your dog friendly doesn mean can invade the space others unfettered ,0
thanks for your insight really hope too ,0
thanks wa scary ,0
just saw the other post you made thanks much going look into further before make this decision ,0
herding dog are like large highly energetic but vastly more affable version cat they want all the door open all the time including the bathroom they can run surveillance everyone the house the same time they establish command center the most inconvenient possible place the house think top the central staircase enable that and when there nothing going inside they will turn their busy busy little brain surveilling the outside well they are busy busy dog don worry about giving them job they are extremely talented doing that for themselves ,0
don recommend them the dog go through they are unlikely come back and doesn keep predator stray dog etc out your yard had dog come though electric fence the past ,0
almost all case spay incontinence can treated with medication however life long could also look into undies pad diaper even happens not vet but think her false pregnancy are impacting her quality life then personally forward with the spay you could also ask about ovarian sparing spay see that would make difference but typically more costly ,0
ovariectomy doesn eliminate the risk pyometria which increase with age ,0
honestly this point going off vet recommendation and don even know dog really need spayed all want her live long healthy life anything can make sure that doe the ovariectomy help with the flase pregnancy mean guess what really want know what would the benefit any all vet keep urging and much trust him cant help but think sometimes that these surgery are just sham way make money ,0
honestly people need fuck off exactly what came here say sorry you going through this all will some point with first dog already had current boy lined knew couldn handle quiet home but wa younger and different place and will admit wa one them when friend lost his last two dog hinting and cajoling about new dog rescue then one day said something that opened eye don want dog want dog and can have dog don want dog anymore for bit thought surely eventually cave but now see own dog getting older and the bond have with him growing deeper completely get already know don want another dog after him done lot dog rescuing done duty for the canine the state currently live boy heart dog and know heart will never want another how will you get through one moment time grief come wave sometimes you will feel like you drowning and sometimes you feel buoyant relief just know that each feeling temporary and will pas but your memory and feeling for your boy never will x200b ,0
just walk around all day with your ear bud your ear and pretend listening music whatever you don’ have even plug them just stick the end your pocket work 1000 and make ignoring other people very easy ,0
know people who replaced dog with the same exact breed and color and even named them the same name not even fluffy too just fluffy some folk are weird like that ,0
honestly the verge cancelling the appointment she always super happy and energetic almost everyone who see her level energy can believe she the false pregnancy will come and with some lactation and whole lot licking sleeping wont last long though and she right back being the happy doggo she going research more into the ovarian sparing spay considering you and another commenter have recommended ,0
yeah wa considering that like wouldn touch person property like motorcycle bicycle but the same time have reason that ha any good intention sog the other hand living breathing social animal couldn really draw parallel guess just don see dog the way see property it almost like went person and started talking them and they like what the fuck did say you could talk just seems kind fucking not saying right just saying that kind how see ,0
your dog really should leash hiking trail all time recall good until they see something that get them worked enough longer great with recall leash law the law the trail you’ irresponsible owner for not leashing your dog end story ,0
sorry for the situation you are lost first dog after month and have had current dog for just over three year ’ travelled the country hiked everywhere she’ saved from depression and she’ just the absolute best sometimes start cry just thinking about her being gone even though right now she’ making high pitched begging whine for her dinner because ’ grown much adult together current dog essential adult identity and can’ imagine life without her what these people are saying comparable telling woman who ha miscarried “just have another one heartless and thoughtless good luck the day and month ahead ,0

100 feel this when put down our family dog none were wa dragged put the room before they put him down and that burned memory forever people kept asking when would get another dog and yeah the empty house yard sucked but just couldn replace him like wa pair shoe but wouldn you know about month later litter puppy wa dumped near some railroad track sister found them fast forward now have dog managing her abandonment ptsd with prozac and clingly pound lap dog who think human wouldn have any other way you always miss your dog but your heart will grow someday when your ready sorry about your pup decline sending good vibe ,0
obviously you need grieve however you feel best but let just tell you had family dog suddenly got sick and had put him down day after christmas wa complete and utter shock were devastated but really didn have time devastated because week earlier got puppy and when got home from losing our dog had another dog waiting for home and needed there for him because wa only week old and that wa year ago and love him just much our last dog ,0
find those people who get replacement dog are just trying make themselves feel better neighbor got puppy when her old golden wa starting have trouble and after died the poor puppy wa lonely had gotten used having canine friend they ended adopting another older dog keep the pup company there right way get through the loss beloved pet matter what hurt dad swore after his two cat passed that would not get another one currently ha four cat all them just kind came into his life unexpectedly different time one day you might find another dog that you love maybe not the same way but just much your dog now life ha way giving what need when need the cat that the closest dad right now wa found near where his other cat wa buried just make the best the time you have left together ,0
time and patience with the dog dictating when they want are ready make more contact the best way our last dog sarah jane had horrid start life and wa very nervy but desperately wanted love and wa terrified anything you can think hit dog with worked with her the basis she set the pace and worked with being patient and making offer touch but letting her the one make the contact first also set rule with guest dealing with her early avoid any upset she quickly learned all touch would good and turned into sweet gentle attention seeking fur missile dad dubbed her that time despite her size she wa gentle darling when asking for attention even with stranger she wander sit beside you and she didn get any attention after short while she gently lean against you looking asking for pat when came the scary thing like hose chain and flip flop just ignored her when she got scared carried and she gradually learned there wa nothing afraid and she wouldn hit with any them that took longer good year more but she eventually got there avoiding coddling her when she wa scared avoided reinforcing the fear instead praising her when she came out and when she got closer show wa all good she never got over her fear body water but everything else went away the point you could wave hose around front her and not even get blink twitch fear ,0
this definitely something consider thanks for bringing this something talked about extensively with them and they want her here and are happy help care for her one roommate brought his cat and although she requires very little work take care help out with her definitely doe know having another dog great for her socialize and get the exercise she need daily basis are intending getting house next year rather than just apartment that way she ha more space and backyard run around though after some thought waiting until get house might the best thing for her want bring her here that way she can get even more exercise than just going daily walk really appreciate the input you given some important thing think about ,0

well yes you went total stranger got their space even though they were giving off signal that they didn want bothered were nervous about you approaching them and then tried touch them that would super creepy and they would the right tell you away even they polite you and don tell you fuck off that doesn mean they comfortable just mean they don want rude are too nervous about provoking you into worse reaction same go for dog lot dog don enjoy being approached pet stranger especially without someone safe like their owner around just like people dog come all sort personality and preference some dog are social butterfly some only want around people they trust some just don like being pet period some only want pet specific circumstance area and forth dog for example love people but also will outright duck their attempt pet him unless give the okay and hate being pet top his head and unlike person leashed dog can just walk away when someone try pet them just because dog isn outright growling you doesn mean want pet doesn cost you anything ignore dog and unless dog outright shoving it face into you begging for pet most dog will much happier you respect their space ,0

lot people make the mistake trying replace beloved dog with new one and then are disappointed when the new dog doesn’ measure the unrealistic standard set because surprise ’ own unique dog with ’ own unique personality and not the dog they’ still grieving for think ’ smart wait and maybe someday when feel right bring home new companion some people really don’ know what with the grief others and make them uncomfortable that they feel like they have shout out any suggestion they can think that they can try solve come from good place but sure doe feel dismissive when you’ the one engulfed sadness from the illness loved one ’ sorry for you and your puppy especially with being the holiday that’ hard hold him close and remember ’ okay cry remember that you’ given him wonderful long life and ha been lucky have you ,0
defense have job where can work from home too but enjoy the comfort being office leaving work wasn’ the biggest deal but felt wa rush this for sure learned curve for ,0
thank you like think that she’ spoiled rotten all the best way she ha such sweet personality that wa waste for her not the house with someone ,0
this coming from perspective since that what familiar with have month old border collie puppy involved sport know the breed well and more than well equipped handle the breed and still wit end with her she the dog everyone thinking when cautioning people against the breed high energy and high drive with off switch the moment the two month had her dealt with both severe resource guarding and reactivity she doesn sleep all unless she crated and whirlwind destruction when she out she get lot exercise and mental stimulation she just doe not know how stop she get probably hour active attention playing exercise training from daily and she nightmare the rest time despite that for hour every day either playing with her training her dealing with her shit both literally and figuratively the only respite get when give her kong bully stick crate her morgan inexperienced home would end with host behavioral issue shelter real quick some make fantastic pet depending line they come from and the temperament however there also good chance they like mine dog should need hour exercise matter how energetic however lot the working breed are easy screw and not for the inexperienced aussie ended with aggression and reactivity issue due inexperience and that not all that uncommon with herding breed wasn even high energy dog just had certain herder quirk that didn know how deal with think this sub fairly realistic some case thing are exaggerated but for the most part people are realistic about breed need and find that most the time people exaggerate case where people are coming with unrealistic expectation the breed ,0
man you are lucky the first time tried this cherry sniffed out unopen bag candy corn that cam did not find the whole week wa uncrated went town them had cam town them and then there were white orange yellow vomit pile all over our couch and rug ,0
wish ,0
thanks this learning curve for ’ never been blown off before and now will require meet and greets and confirmation before anything ,0
exactly you can usually see the answer the person did their research not disparaging exercise training time the breed they mentioned etc dalmatian are cool really people loving bomb proof with child except for some clumsiness kinda dumb but well meaning not good with critter like running trainable the basic extremely heavy shedder either lab hungry over the top finnicky eater love them along with poodle they really favorite breed ,0
yup that wa plan could not raise dog this household ,0
just got few from chewy thanks after many frontline failure switched these last summer and holy crap they work ,0
yup allergy are not the issue here don bring dog into this situation ,0
dog go insane whenever move upstairs room even there someone downstairs with him crazy bastard ,0
more than well prepared deal with high energy high intensity breed and puppy still driving insane can wait until she old enough actually start herding and agility she really need the outlet ,0
maybe gave some people too much credit haha yes you are lab and their cousin goldens are pretty great novice dog mainly because they are quite tolerant owner mistake and even there folk who get them and have absolutely zero clue what take raise dog and then they have nutcase adolescent who chewing their house and knocking people as over teakettle screwed lab though can often unscrewed rehabbed civilized and placed everyday pet screwed malinois can permanently messed rehabbed best can and only placed highly experienced home people malinois painful see what coming into rescue ,0
what the ha job ,0
how much physical exercise doe your collie get thought when they were puppy they didn’ need much haha hopefully grows out progress into adolescence australian shepherd and border collie quite the pair guess that your always kept busy lol think main issue whenever popular and high maintenance dog mentioned aussie husky etc people tend dismiss them and make their own assumption what sort owner they will due their breed choice rather than the actual answer given the questionnaire ,0
the yard doesn have lot with exercise dog don generally well with exercising themselves ,0
poisoning would guess she need the ver right now ,0
start with short and easy around the house for short period time and from there you can both get used only have when you are actually using they have worked great for good luck have fun ,0
pro plan focus adult cat food have been through feeding trial classic mean pate sure you know ,0
fence under your shelter’ rule would have been disqualified immediately giant breed rescue require 6ft fence having fence not wild nor ridiculous request new owner and you not know exactly how rescued dog will behave your fenced yard again fence not ridiculous request have greyhound apartment have also volunteered with greyhound rescue and had one myself they are fine apartment dog know that 45mph couch potato will run for bit then nap the rest the day fine apartment dog aussie apartment long your sister know that her dog need run all good soon her lifestyle change and she ha outdoor the field run lot dog environment that already started off apartment well there are great people out there who would love give those dog long fulfilling life that why try make sure they find their forever home important not have dog bounce around from place place end back our rescue have seen happen all too often which why are stringent ,0
that’ cool wa the impression they were relatively intelligent haha ’ heard their shedding can really intense they have really short hair and they are difficult remove from clothing fabric have you got standard poodle one the miniature one ,0
see that must really difficult situation for those involved with shelter see are aussie often placed into shelter they have become very popular ’ not sure ’ recent thing and could see how they could attract people just based their look rather than temperament ,0
actually think this sub general pretty realistic dont see comment saying lab need hour exercise have aussie and aussie are probably one the most commonly asked about breed this sub not think that aussie need hour running every day have seen suggested not here much but occasionally but they are breed that need mental stimulation and regular exercise and can prone certain issue that people arent prepared deal with and can very well make worse with inexperienced handling rarely recommend them but happy when see someone who seems looking for breed more advanced type training even it just trick think the problem that there are more and more breeder who are breeding low drive lower energy aussie and people have unrealistic view the opposite extreme what breed like aussie are supposed that being 1st and foremost stockdog that physically and mentally able working dog aussie bred what aussie supposed not just average pet dog ,0
maybe just tend come across some the more extreme one that you mentioned sort unrelated note when did aussie become such popular breed and you know the reason why ,0
they not impossible own but they are very different than herding sporting breed depends what you want out dog you want independent dog that happy make it own decision and it own thing they great fit whereas you want dog that going stare you and excited work with you northern breed isn going good fit but herding breed will depends what you want out dog ,0
yeah each dog come with their own set challenge you said all come down what you want out the breed ,0
read that amount distance about two walk half hour each not hour each regardless the exercise need between year old and year old dog are profound after they have slowed down still puppy energy maybe you should check with your vet for any health issue and work training this dog more ,0
not far herding way dance human dog livestock with the human directing the dance and the dog following the human lead term where the livestock should result herding dog were bred pay close attention their owner running away direct conflict with that critical know and understand instinct and what breed wa bred way too many people think dog dog dog dog that all dog are the same inside and only the outer wrapping are different collie breed suck pulling sled siberian set loose sheep due their high prey drive would result dead sheep ,0
exactly there are breed that admire and think are great but would never want live with genetics are really important why baby pointing breed will point baby herding breed will gravitate towards stock yes training important and help mold the dog behavior but those drive and instinct are innate ,0
yeah thanks for dropping some your knowledge appreciate ,0
well gsd sleep with his snoot uncomfortably close face possibly can without annoying with his whisker seems get hint wakedness from breathing ,0
dog sleep the bed with and use love these collar tick are vector for illness that are much larger threat area than worrying product that’ undergone rigorous testing ensure it safety ,0
brachycephalic breed benefit from regular dental cleaning they have the same amount teeth with the smaller amount room certainly wouldn hurt have dentist take look ,0
yeah personally really like akitas but know that just wouldn’ possibly situation also quite like malamute and border collie but again they just wouldn’ able fit into lifestyle and wouldn’ fair the dog wouldn’ able fulfil it need ,0
ton and ton people aren giving their dog very much exercise all they say they want some cool athletic dog but then they want get home from work eat dinner take the dog out for maybe half hour not have anything the house wrecked have play nicely with the child for another half hour and then rest peacefully next them they watch that isn weimeraner one favourite breed isn especially high energy but they are very stubborn and not very social don like seeing people get them baby and then dump them when they are 110 lb and don like playing fetch and don flop around for stranger and basically act exactly the way minute research would say they act warn people they are not for everyone ,0
totally reasonable and common get dog for companionship don think that bad reason all and you have whole year establish routine and training the time our dog wa she had mostly outgrown the rebellious teenage phase and ha been great dog ever since love having her around anytime husband ha out town make the house feel lot le empty you concerned about being able take care your own you have any kind family and friend support system around neighbor that like dog that could come let him out you have work you have the mean hire dogwalker pay for doggy daycare occasion also what kind dog different breed can have different care requirement not high maintenance dog wouldn concerned ,0
yeah agree with what you are saying guess just assumed most people did their research the dog before considering breed and therefore would have some sort understanding their temperament exercise ,0
your saying untrained husky will have the same recall trained one but don think the recall typical trained husky going like the one say lab golden and think even basic recall husky will take more training and more effort than doing say border collie and someone getting husky and wanting allow the dog off leash say park trail and thinking that will trivial teach the dog this going for surprise ha high prey drive may able live alongside cat peacefully maybe maybe all fine for year and then one day the husky say know what and home that know that they simply can not trust the husky good around the cat will have set the house the cat always have safe place while someone who doesn believe that fluffy will some point try eat mouser will wind with dead cat popular breed are popular for good reason lab will more likely handle living busy house with kid than say basenji and someone who want get dog 100 because what looked like say instagram and who wind with dog who doesn fit into most home especially unprepared one will wind regretting their breed choice think people are put off and sort dismiss them due the popularity the breed someone who want have some sort super special rare breed just because rare may again not fare well with the actual dog like when someone decides get their first dog ever and get say cane corso and then decides self train the dog service dog that probably won end well the owner had hoped ,0
split small session throughout the day but would say light day she get about minute exercise and minute training the exercise usually fetch and not constantly throwing the toy give her break and make sure she get water isn super tired when not playing with her she still zoom around the house try chewing everything aussie puppy the other hand slept most the day and wa more low key she should grow out and once can start her sheep and agility that will help also started teaching relaxation since don want her grow into adult that need that level interaction each day get what you saying think that because when going off answer anonymous forum don know the level effort someone willing put into dog what kind experience they have commenters err the side caution ,0
definitely not recommend aussie people who say they gonna hour walk around the neighborhood and nothing other than basic obedience there might some aussie that would with that but whole not sure why exactly aussie have become popular got 1st year ago and seen from being the only aussie around multiple our neighborhood think the flashy color and medium size ha something with people see the merle coat and blue eye unique kinda how they see husky but it actually not very unique they always been more popular some area just even more now guess ,0
any breed become more popular will get dumped people who were not prepared for them herding breed are imho much easier screw with bad handling and poor raising than lab goldens screw aussie and you can get anxious dog that won stop barking bite ha developed compulsive behavior ,0
gene leader face harness not muzzle can still want and breath normally but will extremely easy redirect his head when go for poo any other thing you don want him getting into while walking work great for dog who love street water and get sick everytime she drink ,0
the vet usually bad sign something being weird health wise ,0
take allergy pill day have dog home run out any them late taking them sneeze nose run non stop eye run and turn red dog also sleep bed will not change life with dog and will continue with taking med ,0
toy are free shipping the toy not and they dollar store type toy with roughly shipping per toy ,0
yeah agree 100 that husky recall will most likely never reliable labrador and will also require much more dedication and perseverance get somewhat reliable recall husky are notorious for being stubborn for your second point that’ what wa attempting insinuate there always the potential for incident due the high prey drive the husky whether due the fact that the cat ran the wrong way moved too quickly etc the danger always present about the popular breed thing ’ mainly seen with aussie most just assume they want them due picture they saw instagram something and sort come their own conclusion and make assumption you know what mean ,0
yeah understand ’ much more difficult understand their character through bunch paragraph than say face face interaction ,0
“have great job with and will something make happen soon can get help get help and get work” that wa very encouraging nibble thanks helped him keep the predictive text and removed the nonsense letter lol ,0

not necessarily good comparison make but child who through divorce sort equivalent dog being taken shelter often are affected deeply the experience wouldn surprise shelter dog are more prone separation anxiety experience certainly true you have something that you love and then taken away and you shipped off and abandoned make sense that such thing could have profound effect creature any case dog with separation anxiety going through stress you want try and ease his stress highly recommend treating separation anxiety dog malena demartini she help explain thing from the dog point view and help take you through exercise reduce the stress the animal feel during separation ,0
definitely see german shepherd hard tell without profile him standing would guess half shepherd some lab and something else collie husky both ,0

here fun little comparison between some the dog had term adventure and their breed makeup chow spitz mix very primitive nature the night after she wa spayed and brought home from the shelter she rammed through our solid wood fence kill opossum our neighbor yard the next year were spent constantly inventing way foil her escape artistry chasing her down when she beat and collecting the dead body she left her wake samoyed gsd mix arguably one the more handler oriented spitz plus herding dog once broke tie out taking off into the underbrush chase turkey thankfully came back when heard open the garage door usually not huge flight risk until prey involved australian shepherd once found hole our fencing and accidentally found herself the outside panicked and paced along the fence line trying figure out how get back inside wandering off explore never even crossed aussie mind but for chow that wa her life goal ,0
not pet sitter but outsider suspicious someone with such last minute request honestly can imagine leaving dog with someone never met hour and half after making reservation don mean this comment you you were very accommodating but wonder what with this person because the whole turn event seems hectic emergency happen but yikes ,0
mine are and and they still drive nut from time time there are day when just don’ want wake 5am take them for their 3mi walk ’ raining outside but nooo 2yr old will drag out bed and that doesnt work ’ just and take himself for walk ’ known open front door and deadbolt ’ not that they’ untrained anything spent much effort training them and husband handler definitely know what ’ doing ’ just husky that’ what people really don’ understand this altogether different caliber dog and more ofen than not they get surrendered for being themselves ,0
golden retriever have been breeded numerous smaller animal don know your budget but you can get mini retriever easily ,0
’ look for golden crossed with something smaller like spaniel you get the best both ,0
old pup the opposite ’ cuddle with until knew wa asleep then sleep foot ,0
would very obvious ,0
dog won’ step foot outside ’ raining ’ snowing she will play outside for hour you let her she get drenched either way but only rain bother her ,0
think ’ most interested agility frisbee but flyball dock diving might pretty fun too ,0
the breed questionnaire will give you the best answer far look toller look similar and are smaller but are not the same temperament wise and probably not what you’ looking for ’ suggest looking into the spaniel cocker cavalier may more along the line what you’ want ,0
interesting hadn’ seen either those competition online yet ,0
she doesn care either way not excited about rain she just want for walk ,0
’ heard people suggesting papillon before but never boston interesting would think they would have some respiratory issue ,0
’ really going depend the sport and the level you’ like compete most breed can compete sport some degree compete rally with pug cavalier newfs and many other le traditional obedience sport breed ,0
female golden retriever are 65lbs little bit about your limit really deal breaker most the non show goldens are the lower range not below that weight ,0
walk are going outside the bathroom nope ,0
hate known nope walk raining hard hate the raincoat got him too not much else can ,0
you get the worst because genetics doe not have drop down menu for you select which trait the puppy get ,0
they can more prone respiratory issue breed but responsible breeder breed for health and there are multiple breeder breeding them specifically for sport barn hunt with boston and drophie ha boston she competes various sport with and will adding another sport boston her family ,0
there reason you not fan ppp know lot people are weary purina but lot dog get really excellent result x200b other option victor farmina ancestral grain ,0
’ never had purebred dog life ’ also never had dog with hip displasia heart problem cancer any genetic abnormality mixed breed are generally much much healthier ,0
black tan white normal floppy medium largish ear curly 5in hair all over poofy curled tail ,0
would rather not even with raincoat ,0
cool ’ ha nothing but purebred and never had any those thing either guess you could say anecdotal experience don’ count for much here mixed breed are healthier ’ sure you can explain why friend’ shelter mix ha cost her 5000 surgery for acl repair and ha severe hip dysphasia then ,0
had corgi before this boy she had glorious boot skinny little boy with very little booty still worth getting though ,0
there have been study that seem point into the direction that animal have thelepathic connection with their owner think saw joe rogan podcast with rupert sheldrake about that while back ,0
the only purebred family are folk dog and brother both have had slew health problem but mixed breed are very sound sorry for your friend but ’ very common for purebred have lot health issue mutt generally much le likely carry them the research and ’ sure you will see what mean ,0
really fix sabbatical babbling bag from the gas bill ,0
thanks edited post ’ mostly interested agility frisbee flyball dock diving ,0
email back she ran off guess that all ,0
dog are amazing people and they can profoundly affect human people and you are example that you should judge your feeling worthy honor your departed doggo and revelation your humanity you could incorporate little wwfd what would fudge into your day you could also look for someone who might deserve benefit from greeting that includes you jumping and down and making them feel like the greatest human person the universe ,0
have had purebred collie for year heart problem cancer abnormality ,0
stop trying talk thing out with these people every time you find their dog your yard bring the shelter these dog are damaging your fence contact your landlord and insist they settle the issue because you feel your life endangered this dog the time for talking gone ,0
the emphasis for major college wa animal genetics ’ gonna out limb here and say ’ already done way more research than you ever will which why point anecdotal evidence being worth next nothing here ,0
recommend giving hard look the spaniel family being sporting dog like goldens spaniel share lot positive trait with goldens spaniel breed range bit size color and coat but imho they tend merry charming dog ,0
mine love rain mean mud and mud the best thing ever ,0
groomed ,0
groomed styled not all groomed maintained yes get haircut every month groomed brushed not often but yes ,0
almost and the old collar were smelly and useless hadn had dog year until got june and luckily started with these collar and they blew mind they half great pyrenees with you size and effectiveness for the best price were you buy more than one that price they been tested year shelf stable then they quit testing lol ,0
yeah can hit miss depending your location and the flea density product that still work but you have keep mind been around long time and there are number newer option used advantix for long time with good result but wa happy jump ship oral preventive mess fuss worrying about got onto the skin went intra hair ,0
honestly could just matt his fur ,0
pepper spray isn bad thought just case still trying maintain the peace because and are happy the cottage and the landlord are great worry about collecting their dog the shelter but won totally dismiss the idea for the future either you probably right about the time for talking gone been month hasn gotten better and doesn seem like they working very actively change their dog behavior apart from restricting their indoor outdoor freedom little more ,0
totally agree especially the aesthetic part plus there’ thing like breed typical behaviour that they might not have considered like how lab will carry chew eat almost anything they find how husky are like houdini when come escaping these thing can managed with training containment and some exercise ’ yet see sleeping dog get into something they shouldn’ but they’ thing people should know about advance ,0
flea are ridiculous where live this year ,0
you welcome can beat half price bought extra put the cabinet for more than one year expiration date fda tested for year effectiveness before they stopped testing and put the market ,0
don doubt your issue and agree that seresto collar are great just want point out week could still been the same flea since the life cycle from egg larva pupa adult can take several week even month depending environmental condition generally you see flea your pet there are many others you don see and the environment likely already infested gotta clean clean clean and expect that you may continue see some flea over the next few week ,0
depends what size range you looking love golden retriever intro dog sport breed they are biddable and happy whatever any pace whether that taking agility course slow rocketing off dock sliding down into smaller breed spaniel are great guy and papillon are fantastic down the tiny end poodle are smart fun dog available all size plus shedding boot but the other hand grooming cost ,0
they are hesitant prescribe medication most vet are because isn even guaranteed work and once you start medication you not really supposed stop there good chance more seizure will happen side effect not taking they just asked document her seizure see how frequent they are and how long and got worse then possibly talk about running test like mri yay take all money and other test see seizure meducation the right thing ,0
goldens there isn’ sport they can’ compete except for like herding and other breed specific sport very biddable lot range drive choose from easy live with and there are lot sport breeder choose from the goldens area are incredibly competitive but also good choice intro dog sport oldest dog first dog and ’ definitely challenged certain way but ’ been the best possible dog could ask for for sport partner ,0
have you looked into those sport are your area know dock diving area once year otherwise ’ have drive hour and there are class you would able sometimes hard find one driving distance that work with your schedule and you can afford think ’ better get idea what sport you like and can actually this can affect both the breed you choose and the breeder you choose frisbee and dock diving tend sport you would the side while agility something that much more time consuming you want compete think you should fill out the questionnaire right now ’ just too broad golden good choice for all around versatile sport dog for those sport though ,0
for sure good luck with your pest control haven used seresto personally but have generally heard good thing pomeranian aren exactly rough and tumble outdoor explorer either currently asleep the couch use nexgard ,0
experience the smaller the dog the more difficult ha been train they also tend require you there let the outside for pee break more frequently would recommend looking into rescue most the dog there are trained basic command well house broken ’ not really matter “breed” per but matter the individual dog would suggest doing some meet and greets with various dog and seeing which you connect with who meet your need rescue offer wide array breed and dog with many level experience last three adoption all medium sized doggos pound have all been under the age two the time adoption and they were are truly incredible dog that took very little time training just friendly advice ,0
going assume you never actually rayed their hip joint since mild can diagnosed chalked getting older and that your parent probably didn get dog from reputable breeder that doe health testing x200b not mutt purebred well bred poorly bred ,0
entirely possible especially considering think the orginal source the flea wa from feral cat that feed did numerous flea bath well the topically application kitty are still around and the dog still have access the porch the cat reside under that why switched the collar since they last longer far seems worth while investment ,0
dog don even want out the rain pee read somewhere that dog ear are very sensitive rain because sound really loud them maybe some dog have le sensitive ear but most mine have hated rain ,0
australian shepherd mix ate poop when wa science diet the first year had him wa two year old and this wa what the foster lady had him once switched grain free option non science diet stopped ,0
heh she ha much fur unless torrential longer walk she probably doesn even feel much ,0
“sorry idk where your dog went” they must have dug yard and then escaped” ,0
thanks much for your response and advice haven’ considered looking into rescue but doe seem like smart idea ’ that for sure ,0
ahh that make sense yeah flea bath are definitely temporary fix you ever have issue again consider capstar one and done not preventive meant for regular use but the face battling new infestation will kill the flea the animal under hour and give you head start getting rid the bugger glad the collar are working for you ,0
they hate going the bathroom the rain but they love walk the rain think the difference walk with them the rain and enjoy together but wont out just bathroom break unless super heavy rain then will stand out there ,0
this happens dog too the dog park usually interpret the other dog that barking saying “come out and play ” course doe depend the body language the barking dog the tail wagging doing play bow usually ’ not too worried about especially our dog decides run out and play ,0
have had experience with both breeder and rescue dog the rescue dog have “out dogged” the purebred far the end ’ you decision but there’ just many wonderful pup out there that need home and are living the shelter that think they’ worth noting and said before but ’ say again most them are already trained btw two mix are okay with being left alone for entire work day they’ and pound ’ not ideal but happens all take acclimate them the separation just some interval work let them know that when you leave you’ return kennel training all else fails ,0
side note amazon ha day deal pet category dec 8th there are some decent discount you can get your money litter further ,0

you are going with cage rest you have very strict with pick him carefully take potty and then right back into small crate jumping off thing ever again keep with his med and see your vet for regular check ups depending the severity the case there may may not improvement and likely happen again the future your surgeon will accept care credit scratch pay those are good payment option for veterinary service least the united state ,0

this can happen with any flea tick medicine dog almost died because topical friend’ dog now blind because nexguard chewable really just gotta research and try out what work for one dog might not for another vet said seresto what they recommend for dog who have had reaction other thing ,0
the vet say ’ are completely fine with that ,0
this happened dog she didn’ have topical allergic reaction but she did become extremely lethargic and her personality did 180 she also began seizing problem after removing the collar hesitant use other dog recommend others although glad work well for some people ,0
this what wa going say found our dog about this time last year but didn want take airplane trip with nervous new dog only week later committed but the foster kept him until after christmas ,0
wife nurse she’ pretty point with the med schedule ’ dog would you recommend large small crate currently have him smaller crate big enough where can lay down without hitting the end also sits lot his own should keep him from doing that ,0
haha have the complete opposite experience roller being more active than goldens most the toller population here pretty subdued compared our golden population think there’ very broad range toller type you can encounter much like goldens and there’ going variety drive that will suit different people ,0
’ sorry for your loss fudge growing family had german shepherd mix named fajita got her when wa she lived until wa the time wa wa the only kid home and became sister wa afraid would never love another animal the way loved her the silliest and sweetest gift have ever received wa photo album moment she and shared that parent captioned “her words” ’ one most treasured possession and now husband and send picture our dog each other captioned with what think they are thinking might nice for you make something like that for yourself turn when you’ feeling sad remembering the happy silly time you got share with them their short life make the loss little easier ,0
deaf dog doe odd teeth click the end play solicitation bark with other dog the rest his vocalization are normal but the weird double clack the end when ’ interested another dog something ’ never seen with other dog deaf hearing ,0
idea but curious see what people think can you take video picture though not sure understand some dog are trained like post front their owner protect them maybe the previous owner only got growling and putting itself front you how old the dog and what breed ,0
don live alone but husband and both work lot adopted senior dog with what call reverse separation anxiety love but start get annoyed still around and pestering him about 10am very much like sleep all day getting puppy would hard since they are much more needy they can left for more than few hour time but you willing try the rescue route you might able find very low need dog like mine who would really happy with the lifestyle you provide ,0
good idea ,0
would definitely look into finding qualified dog behaviourist give you tip training her the meantime you should take her vet asap this behaviour biting out character for her could caused because she sick pain ,0
some dog have spinal condition that make licking their back painful try licking her front instead ,0
will and will definitely take her see vet don’ think she pain think that may have been the way picked her startled her but regardless will check thank you ,0
spaniel are similar personality maybe golden cocker spaniel ,0
want say that when tried set sitter for dog rover had issue with the app even sending receiving message had week that thought wa just getting ghosted potential sitter but reality they had not gotten message for upwards day and experiencing similar delay with their message wasn able actually set anything and sure sounded like totally asshole because they would get some annoyed aggravated sounding message from having not received the last message they had sent although someone who already wa trying skimp fudging the number dog maybe wa them and not the app ,0
why would stranger picking her without seeing what happened and what warning your dog might have given you before happened hard know what happened lot dog don like being picked … and most their entire life without being picked ,0
wonder think you heat even neutered dog can react this but just guessing ,0
she will reluctantly what she need then drag back home fast possible ,0
growl back obviously ,0
this good point too and you are right really shouldn’ pick her but she really hasn’ ever expressed any dislike being picked but far warning sign didn’ really have good view her face while wa picking her her head wa shoulder lesson learned look for the sign ,0
that really cool hang there and rest knowing free pain and lived his life great you ,0
those star review with lot rash photo are surely making question seresto ,0
feel like ’ ready ’ been wanting another dog even before wa put down just don’ know would too early for other dog ,0
maybe dalmatian acquaintance mine owns two well bred dalmatian from breeder that breed for both show sporting and they extremely well all the sport she competes them dock diving nose work and ski bikejoring name few heard duck tolling retriever can good sporting dog too have never personally met one used for sporting though can comment how they would actually ,0
hate get the look betrayal ,0
mabel ,0
dog supposed family even wasn’ doing well dog get priority and continues feel special can possibly make him feel giving dog will confuse them and cause them pain once you get dog they’ your responsibility ,0
you can catch the dog the act then you can punish them after the fact specifically outlined how you handle poo pee accident because you wrote have tried bringing him the poop force and yelling him that not appropriate way handle dog having accident crating not cruel good walk before the crate and after you come home help ton and one can tend the dog after eight hour then consider asking someone help walk them midday you got lot can for having situation you folk aren helping make many adjustment for you gonna have reassess your situation and figure out where your cant can become can ,0
came say this the dog need proper exercise like walk hike park and the mental stimulation that come with exploring the yard good for potty break and some fetch but just not enough ,0
you can post just pic the sub share pic add link photo the comment the photo friday thread ,0
did that accident because talk with hand lot haha ,0
this friendly reminder that accident and not accident downvote delete this comment ,0
happy she doing well dog are amazing ,0
wish these worked for ’ been using them for about month now and still combating flea ,0
one cat got horrible rash from them took the collar off and let heal and put the collar back little looser and hasn’ had rash since ,0
hate hate the rain and the snow ,0
wish dog hated rain and cold prefers and doesn’ like heat which prefer lol ,0
the worst super power you can understand everything that every dog saying but every dog seems expressing ’ thought one two word phrase owen wilson’ voice every single bark from every dog everywhere all the time owen wilson saying “ wow ” also you can’ turn this power off ,0
think the collar bit too strong for it own good which cause rash many pet that strong poison flea and tick than won put that dog cat rather see them scratch themselves here and there with few flea them ,0
well asking for reason your suggestion are fairly obvious and already considered them before ,0
lick her the front she still growl ,0
she know assortment trick around now can remember exactly how many good heeling loose leash walking honestly she amazing obedience trick dog had the opportunity work more any lacking definitely fault because neither dog training sport are thing here what amazes are her problem solving skill any kind puzzle you give her she learns how bypass day trick she take stride you hardly ever need more than day get new cue proofed she offer behavior with ease and creativity wish wa better she could much more had real guidance ,0
they are problem especially for the first month large breed puppy can and down few stair but not flight stair without risking orthopedic problem and something ever happens healthwise when the dog becomes elderly and the dog immobile you will need find way carry transport the dog and down those stair have giant dog but live the first floor specifically because this ,0
take thing slow and help her remember that you love her and forgive her for sure double check that she doesn’ have any underlying injury that caused the bite double check with your family fully understand what happened immediately afterwards and very observant she ha any behavioral change like sudden fear anything noise there’ lot thing you can about minimizing the chance bite there’ the typical yelp and ignore tactic ’ sure you have already seen this sub there’ also the time out corner something lot with pup especially get closer having human kid our own build tolerance poking and pulling hand and will gently annoy our pup while carefully observing him sign stress the goal for him tolerate the annoyance ’ poke his nose pull his ear play with his tail etc gently course and the only acceptable response decides ’ too much move away his crate keep eye his reaction make sure ’ not escalating showing obvious distress just mild discomfort ’ happy report that seems going well and wa extremely tolerant whole pack toddler when went camping last summer like the route very carefully observing your dog response stress because believe your dog will tell you what’ going and very rarely will bite occur without warning unless she’ pit bull which believe were bred show very little warning also when you observe and respond correctly your dog body language think your pup will trust you much more protect her and her leader just two cent ,0
feed our dog acana they used hill’ science diet from petsmart vet recommendation and one dog wa twice daily antacid along with since switching few year ago ha not needed his medication ’ canadian company they hold their food higher standard human won’ eat neither the dog ’ little harder find store but not impossible and definitely worth for ,0

one thing always tell people here house that instead moving the dog you ask them move give them the choice however they more comfortable example when younger get the car and you try pick her get her out she sometimes growl you she love the car obviously she rather stay there instead picking her and annoying her just say come out wait for her and then reinforce now whenever ask her get out she doe without problem same go for chair leg anything when have pick her ask her come she stand and get her instead just doing without any warning this little thing but make lot difference something you could try besides going the vet see isn something medical since wa rather dramatic reaction for first time ,0
cute puppy but definitely not yorkie maybe the mom wa yorkie yorkie mix but way the dad wa see jack russell maybe border terrier maybe some dachshund chihuahua ,0
seconding boston boston and couple different sport and ’ say she’ excellent dog play around with variety sport out the one you mention agility awesome with boston boston came second the agility invitationals last year the inch division and flyball boston are pretty common ’ done dock diving with boston before and the big caveat with her she’ very dense she us life jacket but that’ allowable competition ’ not huge deal boston disc are pretty rare but disc small dog are generally not super common because the sport heavily favor larger dog outside freestyle mine also doe pretty well barn hunt she’ environmentally focused though that’ probably part why she’ good the sport ,0

you can call vet maybe and ask them you worried but you should okay might hurting bit but there likely going some waiting matter what just keep eye the pup for behavior change just went through this for chipped molar initial visit referral different vet and surgery took over month get all done though decided get capped instead pulling which would have been faster and could have been done our normal vet good luck ,0

seen dog growl his own hind leg when ha bone ,0
yeah agree with what you are saying guess just assumed most people did their research the dog before considering breed and therefore would have some sort understanding their temperament exercise sadly which why rescue exists people have idea how much work training and exercise some dog need they want chill laid back dog who need nothing during the week the way exercise but who will hike mile saturday good luck with that ,0
you might take her the vet and ask them they may scan her brain and spine check for any injury have golden mix who wa rescued who ha long lasting effect from brain injury incurred before got him only reason know because had vet check every inch him wa pretty bad shape when the pound found him and there wa still quite few sign trauma but not his head something could’ happen while ago that may not visible now ,0

this onetime thing she probably just choked something happening lot over more than day thats vet heart issue can cause coughing and little dog can get trachea damage easily well plus million other thing could going ,0
training reprimanding this the only time this ha happened and she showing some severe symptom that may psychiatric neurological first step the vet something may wrong when you picked her she may have felt sudden intense pain from broken dislocated joint torn tendon something her abdomen her back you don know the vet definitely the first step see there something very wrong dog who are face lickers are just not likely become face biter people they know and trust something very wrong ,0
gotcha figured wa going get her checked out anyways ’ just frequent that one could just see fluke sometimes once month sometimes once week ,0
not sure there real reason behind but one thing sure the cross often make very beautiful dog like yours ,0
ugh hate that such hard call you walk her with leash and collar harness collar tugging their throat can irritate the trachea maybe she ha mild allergy ,0
thank you they really are and wonderful ,0
walk always use harness but take her potty with retractable leash collar she very rarely ever extends fully live old house allergy would option but would ’ such rare occurrence that you’ think that wa the issue why wouldn’ surface more often ,0
hmm none with le than 500 price tag ,0
how your water hard doe have mineral taste bichon had similar problem and started giving her water from britta filter and cleared fairly quickly the difference water probably why your aunt dog doesn have the problem ,0
update what thought wa foaming wa just drooling took her vet and they told wa distemper the woman got her from told she had her shot but apparently she didn ,0
it unlikely but maybe even just the constant “tension” the retractable putting pressure her throat but probably best for the vet sort since there are million possibility ,0

shih tzu doe that usually when not paying attention and she sassy about ,0
boy still puppy but ’ super proud him for being potty trained easily his biggest milestone that allowed spend the night outside his crate now and very good ,0
’ glad hear ’ doing well with potty training since puppy mill puppy have pee poop eat sleep and play the same space they frequently have trouble differentiating between where and isn’ potty most dog instinctually don’ want eliminate where they eat sleep sometimes being raised puppy mill force them against that instinct and make potty training harder also would get him puppy class you aren’ already planning because could genetically predisposed being fearful shy reactive etc puppy class great for any puppy really the health insurance for other genetic issue that the parent were not screened for that may not show until later the puppy life sadly all kind health problem are common puppy mill pup you really don’ know until they show which can year later your dog end needing super expensive hip surgery you won’ have fork over pay for healthy paw great one ’ cheaper sign when they’ puppy and don’ have any pre existing condition will definitely getting for next dog ,0
active belgian shepherd both owner competitor and with rescue people tend get all omg malinois can only owned people who will work the dog and not accurate some dog really need serious work home doubt but understand your raised eyebrow however being involved rescue dog are constantly coming into rescue because owner weren prepared for the breed all not because the dog needed nonstop exercise and work because the dog needed educated owner who could proactive training they thought they could just own dog and the dog would just exist peacefully they weren prepared for the basic element the breed and didn rise the occasion when people are like hmm maybe get malinois automatic cringe because see dog desperate need foster home and adoptive home isn because the dog couldn function active pet home because the pet home woefully underestimated what like own intelligent getter dog that thrives mental and physical exercise not mention the ease finding and obtaining dog from shitty breeder make even more likely end with bad pairing substantially easier dissuade people from getting belgian than play clean later ,0
agree have dane mix and too big move use strictly voice command and the occasional push off the lap when crushing lung thinking still lap dog ,0
not seeing yorkie even body type they tend have rather narrow sharp muzzle and little spark here ha rather broad one and pretty evident within week after birth what kind coat the pup will have dog with yorkie type hair coat will clearly show week the age they got him this smooth coated dog ,0
taste the wild grain free and great for coat you will have specialty store use chewy think ’ around for pound bag ,0
because people think those two breed are soooo coooool looking soo surely the cross them must also totally awesome they are completely different breed created for entirely different purpose with many opposite temperament trait there logical reason cross them just and omg cool ,0
dog purrer mostly when she’ excited see you dog groaner grumbler doe when shift his sleeping position when ’ annoyed you ,0
don know too late the party but not seeing that price amazon ,0
they both common desirable breed and mix the two have superficial appeal lot different type people plus they tend have wolf look that very striking reality gsds and husky are such different breed that pretty much the only guaranteed trait you get mix that will shed it bodyweight fur there really good reason breed the two together since the resulting puppy will highly unpredictable but someone who just want cool dog and doesn any breed research which alarming number dog buyer they definitely have strong appeal ,0
bruce say thanks boneless ,0
where she licking you and where you try lick her you make eye contact think about your body language dog body language also would respect her growl and give her space otherwise you might find yourself bit ,0
the only guaranteed trait you get mix that will shed it bodyweight fur preach brucey get brushed every day and every day could almost make another dog out him ,0
get that the only problem bruce look and act like marshmellow they were wrong pretty though ,0
pet food feeding guideline are often overestimation what dog need your dog healthy weight despite not eating all you offer ’ say the dog probably good self regulating his diet while agree that the drinking seems concern did have dog that wa like that and lived hot climate just didn’ seem need want drink more than did and lived ripe old age wa staffy not tiny dog ,0
sometimes dog act because they are hurting some way ’ make sure they are feeling okay and nothing wrong with them physically then would try get behavioral specialist ,0
doubt it even yorkie yorkie puppy jpg from the yorkie club website example what yorkie puppy actually look like ,0
sorry hear you lost your buddy fudge everyone grief different pace and always worse the holiday ,0
lot people complain about the effectiveness frontline with both flea and tick recommended switching bravecto nexgard advantix people who had bad flea issue saw tick too often and the change ha helped wonder something ha changed frontline the flea tick have adapted personally haven tried soresto but heard good thing some vet also have coupon for them the lobby you end buying some and liking them ,0
kitty have harder time with flea medicine had bald spot and other skin irritation for mine using frontline and revolution feel like take forever for the fur grow back too constant reminder the irritation they went through ,0
for the aesthetic ,0
yeah love neighbor but not that much ,0
work pet dog trainer and dog walker and unfortunately think you being overly optimistic about the average dog owner they don their breed research most people fall love with their ideal breed due the look their idea what that breed like and ignore any negative the core most people tend think dog dog and breed doesn really matter although the same time the breed really important them see lot client with month old german shepherd who are neurotic guardy mess completely over stimulated and out control staffies are another big one that come through about year because people get them and assume that they socialise them enough often inappropriately that dog aggression will never problem and they can good dog park dog only the dog start getting fight regularly and usually they blind themselves until the fight start happening every time severe enough that they start looking for help slowly become the opinion that most the common herding breed acd kelpie here au shouldn for regular pet home there are course exception but just seen way too many dog ruined lack mental stimulation lack understanding their herding quirk which generally result reactivity aggression obsessive behaviour x200b all this say that gatekeeping happens for reason course anyone say dog need exercised for hour day they just plain wrong and not managing and training effectively but the average person downplays the negative and doesn really understand what these requirement actually mean ,0
before you read all the other post here about college and dog ,0
all love wouldn’ know how live life without dog ,0
have been this sub for several month and find lot the advise aimed toward being the cautious side the spectrum there good reason for this many case the ability return dog that not compatible too much for the adopter can sometimes very difficult not impossible otoh have had mostly mutt and their temperament were not always you would expect from the breed they were derived from currently have australian cattle dog mix most likely one laid back except for barking squirrel dog and the mail carrier the other high strung and bark anything moving outside when you are talking about mix there lot more variability but even within purebred there certain amount ,0
owned two yorkies about year ago common issue with the breed that their trachea collapse causing these weird coughing fit always rubbed stroked their throat help alleviate the coughing fit always seemed help and hoped that this might help your pup too ,0
for cat would recommend revolution advantage know bravecto make cat flea treatment but never used have had great result with the dog version though you have flea issue currently also recommend capstar kill any existing flea top the flea medicine stay away from cheap brand like adam and pet armor seen enough horror story about cat having awful reaction these brand that would never ever use them \ ,0
there’ nothing wrong with feeling sad especially not with feeling sad due grieving token the depth your love for your friend are taught society push away feeling like this but honestly much healthier just with your feeling let them they are whatever they are need compound your sadness with wanting stop feeling sad just let ,0
can relate the tough puppy stimulus time would highly recommend looking into diy pvc toy where you just drill hole and the dog have figure out how get the treat kibble out enough for them carry and push around and great training tool for barn hunt you ever want pursue that ,0
️ worked for bayer for while that make them you like them buy lot because they’ closing their animal health product line ,0
’ looked into capstar and read lot concerning review where animal died within hour treatment due complication from ’ made very hesitant try have both cat and dog vacuum daily bathe them get the house and yard treated proforce and washed bedding and stuff weekly can’ seem get handle going look into bravecto something ’ need get prescription for ,0
dog must have more say than “ wow ” mine definitely doe every head tilt start “hmmmm” and can turn into “wtf ” cuz she’ sassy and curious whine say “come mom ” cuz mom’ wimp and doesn’ play hard enough noisy yawn “pay attention know ’ get belly rubbed because ’ too cute ” stranger hear awful bark that sound strangled and ’ sure mean “ don’ play ’ going die ” and bet she belief maybe could say ’ fluent dog but can only spell when ’ translated english ,0
why not crate him rather than confining the cat ,0
this exactly why people say stuff like the talking about border collie need both physical and mental exercise they are incredibly smart dog and need job that mentally challenging just running and hiking with would likely not meet it need because still wouldnt challenged enough this why border collie great agility training obedience training and herding feel like this huge problem that people look exercise need like they would needing run hike etc for some dog that fine but for others mental stimulation key make them happy ,0
haven had similar issue but have you tried talking the vet could that feeling sick something wrong his instinct are still protect his food hence why act possibly hungry ,0
honestly when wa college student had the most free time ever and would have been great time have dog but really depends your lifestyle course load future plan and willingness sacrifice your time for the dog are you currently coming home study when you are not class you stay longer school are close enough come home when needed for the dog what you would with the dog you vacation get sick are you willing sacrifice your free time the evening stay home with your dog instead going out with friend how you plan exercise the dog other concern being able take care dog financially and for the life time the dog are you prepared pay hundred thousand dollar vet care your dog get sick injured will you moving out the country with the rest your family after you graduate have you done research whether you can bring the dog with you and how difficult would the answer those question will help determine wise adopt dog and additionally would expect shelter rescue give more scrutiny college student adopting dog and ask similar question for finding dog would look older dog shelter rescue they should lower energy than puppy younger adult dog the breed doesn matter that much long the personality and temperament good match there are many mutt all size shelter that could great fit another option could volunteering with shelter you have opportunity work with some dog and get some experience with training care the shelter house give volunteer positive reinforcement training maybe there shelter you that will also provide good training for volunteer and with college student schedule you might very helpful volunteering time when most people are working during the day ,0
those pesky vet almost like they deal with different dog daily basis ,0
for month flea and tick preventative that actually pretty amazing ,0
thank you ’ try this next time ,0
shit then definitely need stock ,0
like the solid gold lamb based cat and dog food because lamb le likely cause allergy problem one our cat used get the most horrible sore all the fur gone and just bloody awful everywhere around her neck back base tail more since started solid gold not paid it shill well they send some nice coupon from time time since wrote and told them how much better our kitty all our pet like and are doing well ,0
the day deal and may may not prime only chewy com wa also doing ,0

think you order bravecto chewy you need prescription but you have vet you frequent sure they would okay the prescription write one without having have vet visit have friend that life florida and ha had awful time with flea down there she tried just about every big name brand and bravecto wa the only thing that helped get rid the flea know she us for her dog but fairly sure she also us for her indoor cat too have used capstar personally without any issue and used with the animal the shelter work however can understand your concern and probably wouldn have used home hadn had experience with before \ also bravecto three month treatment for flea think lesser time for tick because how the medicine work topical for cat and oral for dog can also used treat mange dog ,0
yes for flea and tick prevention for month normally topicals and chewable tab average month rather pay than 120 ,0
use victor ’ pretty affordable for the amount food you get and ’ higher protein than other brand get victor profession but ’ also used high pro plus switched because kind smell bad ,0
are those collar toxic human dog like snuggling the couch and ’ worried that the chemical could transferred freak out every time apply the liquid treatment wash hand time lol ,0

adopted dog college student the summer with the same mentality not med student but right before senior year engineering field thought that summer wa the best time because saw the last summer break would have the last summer before getting job and working full time well give you straight you get the sweetest easiest train problem headed your way kind dog maybe work but honest everything go wrong when you don need honestly isn just feed and walk the dog the dog showing some aggression with food treat time either spend time researching how train this out her and spend the time doing spend time and money taking her class behaviorist you name the dog scooting her butt all the time time get her gland expressed your couch will smell like fish your dog too excited when people come over welcome anxiety city when people who don like dog come your house and you have wrangle your dog get ready for the anxiety when you are transitioning full time and having have all the piece click into place moving getting thing ready for the dog bigger deal than initially thought it worth but could back would maybe not least have really taken the time pick breed adopted dog whose temperament knew could handle easily doable but you are for ride because med school stressful right you have exam the next day and your dog running around for whatever reason you unfortunately can tell pooch the weight your situation and why you need sleep you said you are single that will make harder you don have roommate suck hear know feel like only family couple with one person who stay home all the time can have dog and not single lonely people who need dog the most ,0
broken tooth isn emergency but will definitely need veterinary attention preferably from veterinary dentist quite likely may need removed ,0

while totally understand say look other product too frontline petarmor sentry even capstar and you find the same all pharmaceutical and all topical product like shampoo lotion etc have the risk allergic reaction everything doe except with human you have rash from new lotion you see your doctor whereas with pet product you post review and blame the manufacturer horribly allergic two very common medicine that aware far but they from pharmacy not retailer and don post picture allergic reaction mamaw wa allergic nearly all lotion deodorant and perfume and most antibiotic terrible rash but one blame the antibiotic the perfume nor post picture again work mediocre retail job whether you buy not doesn really matter just point out that all flea med have that kind review isn seresto specific and suggest giving them fair shot especially amazon chewy who are both notorious for exceptional customer service you have issue just posted the info because know seresto retail store and half price amazing ,0

dog cuddle kid and myself sleep the furniture etc read report that the epa say child and adult handling the collar and normal interaction with dog not cause for concern few people may experience mild skin irritation rarely with the liquid probably stress too because concentrated but not researched the safety lol ,0
first would talk the landlord about better fence repair are fine but they are usually weaker than the original material normally 6ft wooden privacy fence good place start unfortunately that won’ really help with digging address the digging the fence should one foot underground total\ and beneath that should layer large rock not pebble something least this size but you your landlord can find something lot cheeper this example made seen and you don’ need something that nice covered dirt one either side the fence another two layer the same rock that underneath the fence these rock should from the fence least foot into each yard this not cheep option any mean fact likely very expensive tall wood privacy fence are expensive and the rock even cheep option will get expensive fast but given the size the hole and the dogs’ persistence stronger fence that go underground the only option and even then nothing guaranteed 100 other comment suggested taking the dog the shelter ’ not fan that option this case taking them the shelter should only absolute last resort shelter are overwhelmed and they have more serious issue deal with \ sometimes only foot board available and ’ cheeper just buy and install below above fence than have supplier contractor cut size ,0
look like black mouth curr mix ,0
think rover bit impersonal for such service you might better building reputation nextdoor people are close and you generally don screw over your neighbor x200b have had two friend have really bad experience one had nanny cam that showed the caregiver didn come over the entire weekend the poor dog made mess the kitchen and wa severely anxious the other had one that lost her dog for while when ran out the door because the walker from rover didn leash the damn dog before opening the door now want meet and greet dog walker and make sure they aren completely stupid shiftless before letting them take care dog ,0
have had mixed breed with hip dysplasia purebeds haven had this issue ,0

think she need some time come into her new surroundings don’ overwhelm her trying take her for walk trying force her away from the corner let her make her way out the corner herself and allow her explore the whole house she can begin learn and feel comfortable with the space ,0
genuinely interested seeing any example you have them you look older thread especially year ago further back the response were very different what the response are now think that some people exaggerate little bit and hey guilty too have also noticed le and le people answer breed questionnaire but not because people are dismissive the poster just get little boring repeat the same advice information over and over again when all that information could found with quick search the search bar currently most regular here agree that anything more than hour day exercise unnecessary used see people recommending ridiculous amount exercise few year ago but that trend ha died down from what can tell whenever user say their dog need more than hour exercise there usually someone who point out that their dog probably just doesn know how settle down the only time seen people recommend more than hour exercise when people talk about their own pet well think that there are some red flag that user here have learned identify post not everyone ha the right personality for every type dog breed and best figure that out before getting dog than after getting dog some people come into this sub saying that they want certain temperament characteristic dog but that temperament characteristic turn out incompatible with those people for example this sub often get people who ask for dog that loyal whatever that mean protective that will good guard dog they love the idea hero dog like rin tin tin but they don realise all the work that go into raising well adjusted dog from breed that prone guarding there also lot popular breed that aren recommended for first time owner because they have special characteristic that make them more difficult raise live with they could maybe more stubborn more independent more sensitive le forgiving training mistake le bombproof more sharp etc than other breed personally would not say impossible for first time owner raise more difficult breed but some those breed certainly require lot more commitment and good support network usually from good trainer good breeder mentor for first time owner right ,0
doe this work any better than simparica ,0
sorry for your loss ,0
but now imagine she said all that owen wilson’ voice ,0
when did this start just started dog kirkland lamb and rice kibble last month and week ago she developed fatty lump for the first time her life ,0
look the two week shutdown she need time adjust her new home without also being overwhelmed busy environment you have fenced yard would just stick letting her out the bathroom and then come back she fine without exercise for now help her warm you and your family would get hot dog cheese and cut then toss toward her every time you pas her and keep walking this can really help take the pressure off fearful dog while also helping them associate good thing with their people also with severely anxious dog bringing trainer you feel over your head never bad idea ,0

’ been giving our dog kirkland kibble for the majority his year life ’ been chronologically progressing through the different type their kibble puppy mid age senior and first had the reaction about month ago while eating their senior dog variety switched back their healthy weight dog variety and although helped the lump are still present ’ reassuring but also concerning hear that another dog having the same issue with the same brand food might switching brand just see ’ something about kirkland ,0
would separate them when the older dog growled the puppy will learn and the older dog will become desensitized the puppy just take time ,0
’ just heard bad thing about them but ’ done little more research and might actually give them try ,0
okay thanks try separate them much can when that happens ,0
activate only when display aggressive defensive behavior other dog ,0
giant breed rescue require 6ft fence having fence not wild nor ridiculous request new owner and you not know exactly how rescued dog will behave your fenced yard again fence not ridiculous request except that with the exception specific dog ha already proved that cannot live environment without fence that extremely limiting qualification there are people apartment who obviously don have fenced yard but can still provide excellent home for their dog fact often people apartment exercise their dog more than people with fenced yard yard nice thing have but for many crutch the ability just toss the dog the yard when they need potty for people apartment they into dog ownership knowing that with absolutely exception they have take the dog for walk dog ha potty they going for real walk raining outside doesn matter snowing and freezing temperature doesn matter owner ha the stomach flu someone still got actively outside with the dog you really think that fenced yard where dog ha little human contact during the time used and most dog will not exercise themselves their own better than owner who prepared take the dog for multiple walk per day the very least then feel extremely sorry for every dog your rescue who ha been denied excellent loving and responsible home based your privileged point view just because someone cannot afford house there are part the were home start close 000 000 where actual house don even exist doesn mean they can afford dog and doesn mean that these people can give dog happy loving fulfilling and safe life ,0

reinforcer really only work when the dog emotional state learn not all fearful aggressive dog can physically take reinforcement and learn from their brain are not rational information seeking mode x200b there where proper timing come into play you need get the dog attention using the high value motivator before they reach let alone pas their threshold for example had customer with her german shepherd our place for lure coursing event the dog wa going crazy waiting their turn high prey drive when our neighbor started shooting they have gun range their property the dog started pulling their owner away from the field and towards their car they were going leave when talked them into staying and bringing their dog right into the field run once the dog saw the lure took off about halfway through the course the shooting began again and the dog broke off and charged back owner told them ignore the dog and brought the lure back around the dog took off after few second hesitation and chased once around the field and then the shooting started again the dog started running back owner and reversed the lure and got right under his foot you could almost feel the conflict the dog really wanted the lure but there wa still some fear twitched the lure back and forth and got the dog really focused and started around again halfway around the gun went off and after just brief hesitation the dog continued around the course after just trip the field the dog wa able sit outside the course and ignore the gun shot x200b timing key get the dog focus the reward before they are overwhelmed with the emotion behavior ,0

yes scolding effective the dog would have find the “” distressing making positive punishment for house training manage the dog prevent accident and shower with treat and praise for peeing and pooping the right place limit activity wa bad way put the general idea create calm steady atmosphere and not give the dog too many new thing deal with once given that moving into new home with new people such big adjustment that mean that initially you don’ all kind adventure introduce the dog many people dog attempt ambitious training good luck with your new dog ,0
been researching white swiss shepherd for few year there lot disagreement about them but overall you find breeder that follows their fci standard adheres great health they are known very balanced dog overall they are truly white swiss shepherd their temperament differ from gsd been talking many owner who gotten their w from breeder who have carefully selected sire dam with incredible temperament these dog are not guarding protective gsd and are generally more sociable stranger they also have le hip problem because they have more neutral back have been following along with few owner w who also have gsds way seems like great pairing what heard the w breed are more relaxed and easy going but with much energy and agility then there are owner from few breeder that all claim their w are basically golden retriever white shepherd body minus the slouchy hip overall feel like w aren prone any specific tendency but with any dog varies with each individual and you always need proper socializing training you oregon you should look moro shepherd scio close salem albany visited last month and met lot the dog they were beautiful friendly and extremely sweet they have ton experience used called parson shepherd have recent sire named natus that they imported and have dam that are all healthy with great temperments ,0

what wa thinking but she doesn’ seem distressed ,0
2002 220 1315 ,0
yeah get cat instead ,0
their wrinkle also need cleaned often they collect moisture and can get that damp kinda murky smell them since they are dog with short snoot they can have breathing difficulty and snoring definitely something you will hear some can bit drooly too you can bathe your dog home bring groomer ensure proper hygiene but dog are not human and over washing can lead skin and coat problem dog smell like dog ’ just kinda how go and they shed and can surprising amount given their hair short and smooth even the cleanest will still get dirty and puppy you’ looking adopt young one make quite the mess ’ been working with dog for year and honestly you can not tolerate being licked you might for uphill battle ,0
have been feeling along her rib and that for any weirdly shaped thing can’ find any but still worried would love vet but most vet around here you have pay nearly 200 just get seen not counting anything they give you your appointment ha for longer than minute plus dont book that’ extra think ,0
simply love how the answer are unrelated the question voted ,0
she wa truly sat she would made some noise they were probably their way back even before you screamed and dog breathe pretty deeply when they are asleep wouldnt hurt have her checked out monday ,0
great answer suppose can take care most what you mentioned can you write few word regarding optimum diet and how flatulence can curbed much possible and for the licking part maybe can train them not lick just standing out reach everytime doe and giving them treat positive reinforcement ,0
definitely consider another breed even reconsider your desire get dog keeping wrinkle dog odor free with minimal grooming isn possible flat faced dog tend have more smell than long nose dog imo short haired dog tend have more odor than long haired dog dog with flat face tend have teeth problem because their teeth tend crowed you need keep top minimal isn enough and fresh breath treat water additive dental spray etc almost nothing best all dog fart bull dog fart lot you can teach dog not lick but some are more persistent than others and even dog who can control their licker hur hur are going get you now and then just dog thing like asking what kind boyfriend will never poop scratch his butt want hug you good luck ain going happen ,0
riiiiiiiiiiiiiight ,0
doe bother your husband ,0
mine ,0
you move away and give your dog treat whenever try lick you will learn that licking you get them treat honestly can even suggest way curb that habit they lick people plant other pet themselves couch window floor etc for diet plan you have really see what your dog doe best some are more sensitive some thing than others lot like people and bulldog are kinda known gassy but until you have your dog you may not know what set off more than usual for healthy teeth let him have some good bone chew not the soft stuff that rot teeth quickly they need the hard surface chew naturally keep their teeth healthy hope you find pet that satisfies your desire for doggy friendship and your rigorous hygienic need ,0
that his only issue you should fine think had cat that had undescended testicle they removed when wa neutered and wa fine ,0
you can take old rug mat cut irregular shape and hide dog toy treat different place and make find ,0
standing and giving treat isn going teach dog not lick going teach the dog that licking you mean you get him treat look like this dog licking just part dog behavior basic innate communication just like human smile frown you can teach your dog not lick you regularly but it going have desire give you tongue bath when it relaxing angry just because what dog far diet and fart some dog fart more than others matter what some dog almost never fart some dog are sensitive certain ingredient others have iron stomach but they will still fart finding fartless dog isn possible looking for fartless bulldog even le possible they are super farty breed general regardless what you feed them ,0
bulldog require lot upkeep you have clean out their wrinkle and often wipe them after going the bathroom they also just gassy dog you can try diet keep minimum but they will still gassy x200b all dog are going lick you well that their nature and how they show love honestly bulldog not the right breed for you and don know that dog right for you they can super gross and you have issue with that may not the best time ,0
fuck you ,0
you can check some the best dog training guide dog training book here also check out zak george youtube channel you can find some interesting video the collection that can help ,0
wa blaming the family who decided let their small child walk pit bull without adult supervision ,0
not sure what triggered you here but dont subscribe the crap wasnt even shaming the people who were attacked unsure where you got this from ,0
more personal experience and ha job which suppose probably doe then perhaps isnt home often ,0
dog walked the house that and shared spotted him while smoking outside and lured him with pretzel wa skinny and scared everyone and everything warned quickly and boston terrier baxter quicker they were pretty much inseparable right away the dog rescued named andy andy would have terrible dream and cry out and jump and snarl and wa horrible baxter would get and over him and gently sniff and lick him until woke and calmed down then would fuck off again where ever had been sleeping since they didn snuggle much often cried about this smart loving dog that wa terrified blonde woman and bald white men wa very defensive honestly don think would have taken half long leave the abuse could have taken those dog with now they live with mom the house lived for long andy apparently fat and ha amazed and warmed the heart woman that wanted able fuck off wherever whim ,0
got dog from friend who wa fostering him for friend her her friend decided not take him back wa shelter young age for few week before friend friend adopted him know nothing his early life but know the few month before got him wa loved and well cared for often wonder what like had him from day one but double edged sword cause knew nothing when got him learned behavior body language and everything else could about dog out necessity realized within few week had issue and wa determined help him bigger worry concern constant thought that could have ended with someone unwilling work with and help him the idea him stuck shelter being returned break heart and know didn take him would have ended back shelter ,0
pretty clear from experience that doe exist this science seems seeking answer rather than studying the variable and letting answer come you they obviously began the study most likely debunk the idea hierarchy domestic dog evidenced their hypothesis and they created question and used assumption answer those question anyone who ha walked around dog park had multiple dog time ha otherwise spent any time with dog know dominance exists isnt possible for not considering almost every living system ha dominance and submissiveness these study seemed geared torward creating different culture around dog training the idea that dog see everyone equal only that they depend few people however give two dog one food bowl see who eats more tell dominance doesnt exist ,0
stop rejecting applicant with blanketed criterion life apartment doesn have fenced yard work full time etc some these people can make incredibly responsible and excellent owner and are forced out the opportunity adopt because these basic qualification stop lying about the animal they adopting out don call dog that obviously pit bull lab mix just get adopted out quicker this set the dog for failure when the owner expects one thing and get something else this also set dog for being returned when their apartment hoa city etc ha bsl and decides that the shelter paperwork doe not mean that the dog not pit bull additionally stop sugar coating behavioral issue stop putting much time effort and resource into problem dog dog serious flight risk much that take year find acceptable home this true story from shelter volunteered eventually the dog wa adopted one the volunteer that were specially trained work with this dog euthanasia this project dog can give temperamentally sound dog chance dog ha bite history severe reactivity issue etc fewer resource should dedicated them that dog that are more suitable and safe for the general population are given chance survival just stop with the adopt don shop rhetoric nothing make want support organization le than uneducated blanketed statement that condemns people for doing diligence find dog that fit their family and their need best ,0
okay quick update told father about first pup situation wa understanding and returned the other guess all need now trainer ,0
when your autocorrect type word such fascist indie hater and rutledge you might hipster communist from the pacific northwest san francisco ,0
thanks for clarifying ,0
supply chain too broad term the manufacturer likely produced line dog food per agreed specification distributor that distributor may own one brand several brand and each brand us own formulation seems that the manufacturer produced food out spec and didnt have the proper quality control catch the problem before their product made market generally you would have statistical basis for checking periodically the output catch any non conformity thinking that the manufacturer either knew about the issue and ignored doesnt have any quality standard place the latter that tell that this food likely ha other issue with formulation and possibly made with le than quality raw material ,0
which shouldve been caught during their randomized output testing prodcess ,0
would really appreciate you pmed your dog old owner about their breeder thanks much for offering think might add rough smooth collie list breed meet person next poodle too based your advice and you don mind asking who the breeder you mentioned who breed service collie would love check them out they sound awesome think might agree with you about newfies the only dog worked with very quick and trying guess your next move they can get the treat and not really seen any newfies get crazy about training like that think this point after all the recommendation for golden smarter for choose golden this time than newf were between them have thing about washing hand any time get some kind liquid anything sticky them and could see myself having hard time initially getting used drool the grooming sound little daunting too hmmmm didn know the breed existed until few month ago the info online seemed positive about them and like they were very balanced though which sounded really nice maybe should look into them again you think they could work look the club and see they have breeder this side the cast thanks very much for such detailed info ,0

just because you want certain breed and age doesnt always mean they fit well with your situation except that many rescue take this way too far wa automatically disqualified from adopting from our local golden retriever rescue because live apartment didn matter that worked from home didn matter that had history with this breed which fair relatively easy one didn matter that husband and had both been active volunteer shelter for over year and result knew thing two about dog their behavior and their requirement yard dog period ended going through reputable golden retriever breeder not single one them gave damn about our lack yard active young couple that already had plan place make sure the dog wa given the exercise needed our dog ha happily lived apartment since wa week old ha been trained and consistently receive compliment about how well adjusted calm and sweet the issue that lot rescue think they know best and fair some case they but many case they don there are people that can have high energy dog apartment there are people with young child who are able juggle giving both the kid and dog attention way that are safe for example you used the example kid with great dane puppy our last apartment complex one our neighbor had year old year old and year old apartment with young great dane wa the dog big and energetic yes wa the dog mistreated neglected were the kid ever danger because this dog the parent ha strategy keep everyone happy and safe and that what matter there are young unmarried couple and even college student who can make wonderful responsible owner but many rescue are ready make snap judgement decision and reject applicant without even having conversation ,0

you have anything that could function like onset that would protect his incision but le stressful than the cone ,0

may have been given methadone and sadly constant cry and feeling confused common effect will diminish and pas over the next hour that but don’ hesitate call your vet and speak them and ask what ’ been given and this side effect need seen for more pain relief check over call the out hour service and they will hopefully able advise you without having wait for your own vet opening ,0

all dog have general odour about them and smell others have highlighted bulldog aren’ super great choice for limited smell and hygiene the one know all seem drool lot lick the floor and make loud sniffing and slobbery noise the fold and short coat these dog often get yeasty smell that find most other dog breed lack not the dog for evidently but there are lot thing you can encourage you with reputable breeder who breeding dog’ that have healthy skin and le dental issue meet the parent and see you are with their odour and ask about how the breeder maintains upkeep their teeth fold and coat also think you will nose blind eventually and you won’ notice your dog natural smell for the licking totally get love that you are thinking along the line positive reinforcement training for your dog instead punishment that’ awesome licking wa that big deal would train dog using negative punishment literally just mean removing something decrease the likelihood the behaviour repeating dog lick leave the area dog lick stop petting dog lick turn around and ignore this for second and return like nothing happened and repeat every time you are licked this strategy use train puppy not bite too hard can’ see why wouldn’ work for licking would also pair this with positive reinforcement where you reward puppy dog with treat when the dog doesn’ lick situation where usually doe ,0

month old puppy might just lack control make over the designated area for baby you gotta when you gotta ’ not expert but this ha been experience for biting you can gently hold his mouth closed for couple second and calmly tell him “ ” even when ’ just gently nibbling discourage this for him ’ hard understand why biting only sometimes and even doe understand can hard remember not bite too hard when get excited also and trust know this hard when you’ got wild doggo your hand try stay calm when being rowdy that doesn’ pick any tense body language and translate that more play ,0
sound like you love your pup more then you husband just sayin ,0
considering that she ha been fostered home will make lot easier the travel might mess with her for few day including her bathroom habit don surprised hurt she doesn play with her new toy right away she need time feel safe hand feeding great bonding exercise yes this good idea you already mentioned you have schedule don push and don make the walk long intense everything will new including the air she will exhausted for while similarly don push the training much secure harness until she ha bonded recommended prepared give her bath after the trip the bonding take time just patient will happen ,0
girl had been least six place before she ended shelter though don know she had been stray surrender she wa there for over month adopted but then returned another month later due being incompatible with the other dog the shelter wa over capacity the time and she would have been immediately euthanized not for worker that saw something special her who pulled her out and put her into boarding facility until she could transported several state away she then spent two month foster care between two different home she sensitive soul and the stress ha certainly affected her suspect she wa not properly socialized pup because she nervous around men sign abuse though thankfully think about how close she wa not getting another chance and that break heart ,0
feed mix two different brand not for this reason but will make easier switch without much digestive upset should ever need cut one them out ,0
your dog great but maybe you need put down your husband ,0
that’ completely understandable one need told that they “should have done better” about time like that ,0
shoot get puppy next week would have loved hear his opinion this topic ,0
unfortunately think would for the best return tashi rescue ideally one that familiar with the breed there are few the and the rescue you went through can find out what breeder wa bought through the breeder may very well open taking him back are very independent and not socialized and trained properly very early age they can become agressive towarda stranger and other dog trainer that ha experience with very demanding breed like may able help but given the history you mentioned think may best return him run the tibetanmastiff subreddit and have own will back later post some rescue link that may use ,0
that great explanation thank you ,0
thank you for your reply your feeling are unfortunately most similar mine really appreciate you taking the time write them thanks ,0
don’ believe feeling afraid threatened any his trigger the elderly dog basically crippled arthritis ,0

wa this municipal shelter from dog care point view that sound great but from legal perspective make nervous ,0
this what dog say “ fdfrqnf zen znfcgcxc xcxcx gnfbne cer rtfs rsvrvis brings “ ,0
and hurt the dog chance getting adopted had similar experience volunteering adoption event one the dog wa barking constantly like you could hear this poor guy over all the other barking dog there they gave him rawhide and stated squabbling with his neighbor crate were right against each other they finally put piece cardboard between the two crate stop the squabbling ’ sure wa good dog that wa probably just overwhelmed the event but think actually hurt his chance being adopted ,0
personally think were part beagle would have bigger ear and were part boxer would have shorter wider face possible the mother wa heeler aussie shepherd mix and the father wa probably some sort random mix with maybe something like german shepherd ,0
think happy owner make happy dog you’ super stressed out having this dog the dog will know and worse like you said you might neglecting the dog some way like consistent training that could create some long term damage the dog especially one big and potentially unruly the breed you described understand that ’ hard because you love the dog and ’ le sure what the best plan would that you might consider asking around your friend network for people who are better situated financially and emotionally for dog ownership you can dog adjacent without being the primary caretaker but defer wiser head that idea ,0
why wouldn’ you want daily brushing brush our dog’’ teeth every night the same time brush our own make maintenance easy and take very little time don’ want pay for veterinary dental work can help and have breed with healthy dental genetics unlike the bulldog dog’ teeth can and should remain very white through it lifetime yellowed teeth have plaque and are unhealthy you want dog clean and smelling nice going require some sort maintenance matter the breed all dog smell doggy some more than others short haired breed that tend get really smelly all dog need coat dental maintenance flat faced dog need wrinkle cleaning and for their drool maintained since they have flappy jowl they are going produce more drool than average dog and you want make sure that drool cleaned away their face doesn’ stay moist which make them prone bacterial skin issue flat faced dog also need dental maintenance more than other dog since their teeth are very crowded and can prone rot which will smell very bad not maintained addition flat faced dog are more prone gas all kind since they are unable get air into their nose properly due the way they are bred their constant snorting going produced lot excess gas their body and doe have somewhere dog clean themselves well extent but remember this includes licking their butthole genitals your dog can’ reach these area it own that also area that would need cleaning dog sometimes can’ reach old age when they are oddly constructed this part dog ownership dog haven’ had bath since april this year and personally think they smell great their coat are very healthy and their teeth they have faint doggy odor but doesn’ smell bad just like dog ,0

adopted him when wa day old from litter garbage dumping area and and his mother responded well picking him this after the fact and don mean ragging you and your family for what you did sure you thought you were doing good thing but bringing for anyone reading this and the same situation would have been far far far better take the whole litter with mom crazy sound leave him there with his mom and litter until that could done being removed from his litter and mom such young age can really mess pup from birth week the minimum age pup should removed from his litter pup naturally learns critical lesson dog socialization and you have seen bite inhibition not bite and using teeth able control the pressure their bite between pup those lesson are clear simple and natural and honestly human can duplicate them well taking pup early removed from his litter one those thing that best fall experienced hand and you need aware this task will incredibly challenging and you and your family need lot patience ’ barely spent any time outside the house and now over month after pup start toddle around they learn surface preference and favored environment eliminate from their mom wa with her and his litter during that formative time would have developed preference eliminate outdoors and natural surface dirt grass instead wa indoors during that time and thus ha developed preference for eliminating inside and hard and carpeted surface didn purpose frustrate you and your family this inadvertently what wa taught the issue that once formed this elimination preference can very hard change and why now peeing and pooping everywhere not totally sure but partly because him all indoor floor are basically all the same with collie pup they come with natural preference eliminate grass and dirt try teach them one spot our backyard and that much harder concept for them grasp surface preference pretty hardwired now but knowing just one area isn and along with dog socialization and bite inhibition housebreaking will challenge you will need extremely patient and able hold your frustration check ,0

trying discus the data with you you said have point this were the sole article try address your other link instead just your first link but first all you said pit bull disproportionally cause life altering injury like permanent disfigurement and permanent nerve damage but haven seen article that detail that you also said can tell pit bull their blocky head and muscle well seen plenty dog with blocky head doggydna that have le the pit bull breed the pit bull breed being american staffordshire terrier staffordshire bull terrier american pit bull terrier american bulldog etc also seen dog that look exactly like stereotypical pit bull but also have le those pit bull breed finally seen dog that don have blocky head and are lean and long opposed muscular that have those pit bull breed and seen dog that look exactly like stereotypical pit bull but they only pound when fully grown this criticism breed specific legislation how earth would this legislation enforced ban the dog after administering dna test ban the dog that look like pit bull that are also big enough cause harm okay the pediatric dog bite injury year philly review this article also drew the conclusion that there inability determine with accuracy the exact breed dog due similar characteristic among multiple breed you said this article state that the documented case this study were pit bull bite and that absolutely true but the article detail that these breed are popular crime ridden and drug ridden community also the article supposes that these dog may been trained bite prone attempt manufacture guard dog and these breed may unfairly blamed for the bad behavior their owner the article also cite previous study such gershman study denver that said bite injury were the result mostly chow chow and german shepherd and schalamon study austria stating that german shepherd and doberman pinscher were five time more likely cause bite injury than other dog despite being le than the dog population despite gathering data dog breed this study the article conclusion doe not make recommendation with respect breed specific legislation contrast the study recommendation age appropriate education measure dog bite prevention okay got just summarize what read all the above article every article state that very likely that the disproportional amount pit bull attack stem from the fact that people train these dog guard dog your last link state this plain english this may explained the increasing use this breed guard dog not saying that dog behavior 100 nurture but saying that pouring over these case study doe show that the overwhelming majority reported pit bull bite stem from owner deliberating training aggression into the dog for the purpose dog fighting creating guard dog you say that you considered fact like socioeconomic status pit bull owner but have you because lot this data doe suggest that poor people dog especially dog that are trained guard dog are the disproportionate biter the fact the matter that lot easier for poor person obtain pit bull than for them obtain purebred doberman pinscher but when doberman german shepherd are also trained for aggression those breed also tend bite finally wanted come back the first article and quote saying that all dog bite injury studied are from the victim own personal pet question why you guy care owner legally required keep his pit bull leash within his fenced property owner let his pit bull roam free then should obviously liable for any damage similarly neighbor shoot with his gun would want him punished and want him longer able legally own firearm but ha gun his home why should care statistically that gun most likely hurt it owner rather than neighbor ,0

mean you can measure someone love for animal for some dog pet really everything fascinating because while certainly anecdotal had people say that putting down their pet their dog dying hit them much harder than any death they been through including close immediate family member further this thread someone said that their dog dying wa par with their mother dying not child but this the closest metaphor can think this instance think the most awful people the world then think about how flabbergasted you might when you hear their parent still defend them like talking about serial killer mass murder serial rapist etc who confessed and were gleeful about what they did but then their mother father defends them even torment and taunt the victim family their child defense like that guess bond between parent and their child very very special for many and are their pet the same vein you yeah that violent aggressive dog wa ridiculous but her isn honestly you would probably think reaction putting dog down wa over the top and probably scoff happened labor day and still not okay wa service dog and had him since adopted him when wa month and had put him down when wa almost still not okay still mostly inconsolable can even mention his name without tearing dramatic that cried least once day since then some yeah over the top that literally vomited from cry from the pain that gone again yeah some dramatic that struggling function without him even though had technically been retired and helped train current service dog who actively helping several people would say indeed dramatic for however wa heart dog had many before him growing always had least dog the house and quite few were mine and will probably have many after him but wa sort the dog for but had some say wa just dog for many will never just dog matter what her maybe though someone put baby her doorstep think bit conceited say that only certain situation are applicable for referring someone dog just dog you aren that specific person you don know what that dog new otherwise meant them how maybe this new dog ha helped her cope will say that hope she getting help for the dog though ,0

that protective dog breed like gsds dobers rotties will able magically tell the difference between intruder and friend the mailman girl scout and will only bite people who are actually threat without any sort training also that they bite people all instead just warning them off with barking ,0

just patient and dedicated hard wouldn expect your dog stop this problematic behavior rafter only few day though hopefully start get better try give this least week depending how much any progress you see you don see any meaningful improvement after couple week would maybe consider hiring dog behaviorist look into anti anxiety med cbd oil not saying that necessarily put him drug and rather solve the problem with training but maybe start researching and talk the vet good job far though stay strong you got this ,0
unless they wrote the address and access info down the guy stole package while the job think pretty safe say thief who might misappropriate the information received from the app ,0

thank you very much for the advice and sympathy not sure the size the place yet still looking for breed eyeing border collie also which may easier handle regarding dog the same space but want male and kinda leaning towards husky shepherd anyway haha enticing breed ,0
others have already said police and local news but ’ call them out twitter too seems like business get shit done sometimes when they’ called out publicly twitter ,0
and add that while think temperament much more important than size think the new dog being more than twice the size the old dog make bit harder for her warm him for instance very kind but when they the door greet someone usually inadvertently push her out the way since big counteract this usually make point pas him and pet our old girl first when come home she growled him gently couple time for inadvertently crowding her just because big and going the same thing but she hasn done that for awhile and think learning respect her space more ,0
easier fool people they preliminary test and leave that lot people know that hip and elbow should tested but not how the test work and what age they should done for breeding dog two year age the minimum for most breed until then many genetic defect can stay hidden before emerging full maturity around two three year age breed ha eye defect look out for those test are done yearly ,0
wow really cuz signed dog walked and have been getting slew email and text about application know they’ there ,0
they just euthanized one this breed okc got through broken chain link fence just elementary school let out and bit and chased kid following some into the school building guess some kid were hurt badly enough that they still missing school two three week later either because bite because fall from panicky running ten day the pound make sure wasn rabid assessment that wa too dangerous and death dog whose owner still unknown this breed requires very experienced and invested owner and they frequently attract adopter who are anything but knowledgeable doesn matter how many good pit mix there are the mechanic their jaw can argued with they are capable biting and holding way other domesticated dog can count having once been the parent who didn understand that year old can expected handle dog leash the suburb another dog charge and the kid fall because the dog take off running and there longer any control the situation lesson learned didn let kid take the dog out again till high school age nobody got hurt that time except child had good skinned knee awfully sorry your mom ha gone through this traumatic experience ,0
kong dog bed ,0
technically any sign symptom during the probationary period before can considered pre existing condition with without diagnosis you’ discussed this with your vet all ’ likely their note which you will need send healthypaws for your first claim even you haven’ discussed you seeing the sign and symptom and not disclosing that could construed fraud unfortunately may not possible get coverage for his issue ,0

train her give her great experience she need your guidance and leadership she need appropriate amount exercise and socialization great dog are trained they are typically not born that way ,0
since you are far away would just let your mom and dad know that you are there for them x200b for the pit bull feeling it completely valid start dislike breed after something like this happens but try remember that wa one dog and not the whole breed not fan poodle because similar reason attacked dog when wa walking sent him the emergency vet and needed few surgery and will probably never own one but don think they should put down outlawed also pit bull isn really breed it encompassing term for typical look dog used breed now called the american staffordshire terrier but everyone started using the term refer any dog that kind looked like that boxer mostly but other bully breed too should something done about this pit bull yes but that doesn mean something need done about all pit bull x200b also very sorry for you loss losing pet hard losing one this manner harder hope your mother can heal over time ,0
then you should have her cognitive function checked and the supplement you should look into for that senilife ,0
got dog cot for pup because ’ eat anything moderately fluffy bed blanket towel etc although not sure how well would work crate dog ha his own dog proofed room opposed crate ,0

and even doodle breeder did health testing and only bred dog with good temperament there’ still going good amount variety how the puppy turn out which defeat the point going breeder just get shelter dog then lol ,0
you aren’ equipped with finance training experience handle correcting behavioral issue that isn’ you being failure it just not something you are equipped maybe rescuing “troubled” dog isn’ for you you’ had brain injury dog and now dog that may have some fear aggression issue not sure this second dog really horrible but you are fearful that not going great situation all this say what best for you and your family with the current rescue then instead picking method getting dog that appeal your vision what “right” find method that will find you the right dog rescue isn’ for everyone doesn’ have ,0
the police and show them the footage this person probably took the job from wag specifically they could steal from people they likely again already have ,0
love fixed rescue dog issue would thousand dollar richer right now ,0
well said and another thing that dog breeding should have purpose and that mean breeding towards standard eventually you gotta produce something consistent what temperament size coat type and energy level should doodle have the guy who invented the breed actually had goal wanted produce non shedding seeing eye dog didn’ succeed and actually regret creating the breed and starting the doodle trend apparently some breeder australia are trying turn into legit breed but will while before that happens breeder isn’ breeding standard either find different good breeder get shelter dog ,0
your friend gave the door code key complete stranger and let him into secured area where all the package are displayed like christmas present only trusted individual should allowed inside this building seems like your friend partially blame for the package theft wouldn want share the same building your friend ,0
feel the same way when good boy sits front with his back and back close and lean into chest with closed eye while hugging would stay all night giving him love ,0

would upset and heartbroken would angry and feel like that dog villain and must stopped know not all pit are like this but make hesitant want around them know this must hard for you and your family especially the pit had family that cared for the way your mom doe for her dog may pitbull and don’ like them all but they are living breathing creature and ’ impossible not have empathy for them their owner unless you’ sociopath ’ both angry and conflicted just like you pit can dangerous because they have the ability turn vicious very quickly and they have the strength and the bite actually kill but there are many harmless skittish needy loving and protective pit who just want cuddle with their human and wouldn’ hurt fly really any dog ha the ability snap chihuahua pit pomeranian poodle all can some damage but they’ still fur baby that need nurturing love and training this one just need have the owner accountable for the dog lack training supervision public dog can real harm emotional and physical the person doesn’ know gotten comfortable with dog ,0
senilfe good too ,0
hate that stereotype much have met many wonderful chihuahua and chi mutt girl mostly chi and she great hiking buddy and the best snuggler the world ,0
thank you have been working training her and taking her socialization class since got her month ago she doe well but still nervous sometimes wa just shocked that she actually bit someone ’ threshold that should never crossed and know ’ our fault because she got out when she should have and you are right our dog before wa amazing but did require some work wa never aggressive but would bark excessively didn’ get exercised every day hope can work through this because she sweet girl and deserves loving family ,0
seeing that now didn’ have child would have felt like could deal with anything but have little life that must come first now are keeping this dog and are going work with her can’ overcome this and feel ’ too much then will try find her better home but hope doesn’ come that doe will probably just stick with cat for while lol ,0

the advice have read excellent and really have nothing add most family ha dachshund they are amazing animal much personality very sorry for your mom loss you think she would appreciate would more then happy send her condolence card you can message her address yours know might seem odd but when mother dachshund passed away she donated his belonging local shelter they send card thanking her and sending their condolence and meant lot her might help ,0
wish pup wa like yours early the morning before get stand and hovers over doesn’ bother but the shuffling and standing pitbull doe wake the good thing ’ usually let sleep doe get let out early roommate but ’ the one who walk him patiently wait ,0
honestly this doesn sound like terrible situation she still very young and learning about what and isn appropriate behavior the fact that she didn bite hard enough break skin even though she wa very stressful situation alone the dark with something scary approaching her after she warned them off barking show that she seems have good bite inhibition definitely keep working socialization and don slack off management adolescent dog should never off leash unless contained environment but she never shown sign fear aggression with stranger your kid normally wouldn write her off yet her behavior escalates then you should start thinking about giving her back before worsens your child are the priority here and she have much better chance finding new home she ha serious bite record but for now this sound like fairly typical reactive behavior from puppy who already ha nervous temperament and wa suddenly thrown into high stress situation that said don feel guilty rescue isn the right way for you long you not supporting puppy mill and bybs there nothing wrong with deciding that you don want take the risk with rescue dog when come your family ,0
yep blow and social medium account they have ,0
well that wa helpful ,0
welcome having puppy you can try the yelping technique but that doesn’ work for some dog might egg him puppy did not respond “ouch” until wa little older and more understanding communication you should stop giving him attention when bite you walk turn way persistent time out honestly with puppy the biggest thing wa giving him other thing chew like frozen kong delicious chewy treat soft toy and natural maturation ,0
love that you feel this way about your dog have tiny tiny dog and still feel this way recently discovered that year old 10pound dog capable running mile and love you better bet that ’ running mile with him after work most night even though hate running just like ’ run for this pup ’ buy unnecessary dog toy for the year old pup see her light for minute over new toy brings more joy than anything else know that they are happy satisfied and truly family more important than nearly anything else the hubby pretty high the list importance too aka secretly dread the day become real parent love fur baby this much can’ imagine how much ’ love kid actually made and not bought adopted from pound ,0
goldendoodles are great dog they love their human almost excessively they are very smart and playful and will somehow find way outsmart you but will still look it human for comfort and safety they’ very protective reputable breeder for goldendoodles would the goldendoodle association north america they won’ cheap affordable but you can believe you will have ethically bred dog who well loved and cared for however second that ’ dog and while you can like certain breed dog because ’ cute you need okay with the responsibility caring for that baby mean puppy older dog ,0
think hinting that her friend should take the blame and move instead pestering wag for reimbursement since her friend also share some blame ,0

long dog leash and elevator just give anxiety the door close before the dog get good luck ,0
clearly you haven’ connected pet much this guy ’ married and can tell you that the dog ’ had for year prior meeting husband mean almost much doe some day more ’ been dick this dog know more what mean love unconditionally than any person the world and she got through countless heartache and breakup before met her “dad” obviously love husband more than anything the world but sometimes pet come you the right time and just make loving life and the world one hell lot easier than would you were alone that’ invaluable ,0
sound like separation anxiety this can tricky but manageable there are lot great articals online about have done the technique where you leave for short interval maybe few minute time and get their tolerance you just moved would assume also anxiety about not feeling home your baby need time adjust comfort your dog and they will settle ,0
omg glad not the only one who truly love their pet this same way have year old pug world cuddle and kiss him daily talk him and stare him lovingly when chillin lap just napping truly the spoiled one household and have other human kid home lol can have bad day not feel too well and fur baby make feel better can even bear the thought losing him one day get teary eyed just thinking about call crazy don care love fur baby and love ,0
care ,0
roflmao ,0
think you should definitely but gently keep allowing her socialize the dog park tricky though ’ not always good experience even for very social and care free dog would encourage you ask your friend and family member with dog have puppy play date that way you know the temperament the dog your puppy interacts with and she doesn’ get overwhelmed then you can continue the dog park would encourage you exercise caution and leave the first sign overbearing dominant dog you want make sure that your puppy having lot positive experience pas the dog park and looking like there too much excitement won’ even and that’ with know fear dog big puppy but still easily steam rolled and because can the obnoxious side ha been aggressively put down other dog luckily ha not had any injury ,0
think this more misunderstanding wolf than anything else the one the zoo near get walked leash ,0
the line between specie and subspecies murky one best spent year working the wildlife field and with bird who were variously defined full specie subspecies whether the taxonomist charge were “lumpers” “splitters” taxonomy the attempt human define the natural world and therefore subject human trend thinking taxonomy cyclically swayed “lumpers” that tend combine several specie into one and “splitters” that can pull specie out one they upgrade subspecies into specie ’ worked with subspecies that have been genetically and geographically distinct for generation and are visually identifiable from other subspecies yet they are considered subspecies until splitter come back into favor all this say yes dog are subspecies wolf however they diverged from wolf approximately 000 year ago and case would say they are not interbreeding which would further isolate them from the wolf specie that they are sub defined under they certainly don’ behave like wolf and they aren’ shaped like wolf practical sense they are completely distinct reading book study about wolf would not inform you about dog too many people want feed their dog like wolf read about wolf pack behavior study which are often fundamentally flawed they are mostly study captive wolf artificial pack thinking that they’ learning about how their dog think ,0
boyfriend kid told him one day that they are pretty sure like the dog more than like him agreed with them lol ,0

behaviorist and trainer recommend that puppy stay away from dog park until they are least month old they are very impressionable stage development and one bad experience can affect the way they feel about other dog for the rest their life better set play date with known healthy puppy loving dog and puppy their own age puppy socialization class there also the health risk you can know the vaccination history all the dog the dog park and since your puppy not fully vaccinated yet you are taking significant chance with your puppy health ,0
good know thanks ,0
week pretty young for dog park opinion you can never predict the behaviour other dog also doe she have all her vaccination ’ not sure most puppy get all their vaccination week wouldn’ risk certain illness can seriously harm even kill puppy dog had parvo puppy and nearly killed him take her the vet you are worried ,0
from what read previously legaladvice wag doesn really have employee but rather independent contractor this kind like hiring someone out the classified ad and then going after the newspaper when something go wrong your groomers case against the individual not wag and their term service state about that much and remove them from liability definitely take others advice and bring that video the police caught you may get the rekeying and your money back for the original service well him facing charge for the mail theft but that probably the extent not the local news social medium without speaking lawyer first you have case could harmful and only local lawyer can really advise you that ,0
quite simply there such thing just dog cat whatever specie your furry friend came home from nearly hour day mail carrier holiday season the unbridled joy two mutt and assorted cat yes wonderful husband wa there too but the animal are just there for the love question just happy face can duplicate that ,0
now just sad our noodle wa rescued from shelter and love her much the idea that people can that these poor baby really prefer dog ,0
nope it just who potty train her ,0
agreed parvo and giardiasis are serious for puppy ’ not worth the health risk ,0
’ not opposed intentional cross breed they’ being bred responsibly the unfortunate thing that’ not really thing with doodle ,0
did you read your policy should spell out any waiting period and other detail about pre existing condition also you may jumping conclusion with your proposal allergy shot have you already checked for normal cause like flea mite shedding etc also small amount itching not necessarily problem all finally agree with avridt that lying about this condition insurance fraud you might able get away with but illegal and morally questionable best ,0
100 myth ,0
wag not the place hire professional pet sitter ’ sorry for your friend wag will not legally have anything and chance are they will not ,0
yet many the food those brand also fit the dangerous criterion ,0
call “teapotting” because that’ nicer word for the boston screech ,0
assuming you not talking about puppy don see any reason why there need correlation between feeding and walk having routine helpful for everyone but don think matter much what that routine ,0
this isn’ quite right most like national park not allow dog trail full stop ha nothing with waterfall danger general unless you have very small dog dog are more harmful wildlife than vice versa dog probably drink more “wild water” than tap water have never had issue with parasite from water ,0
start riot put twitter and facebook flash mob the police station wearing shirt with bacon dressed cop clothing while projecting the video the wall ,0
maybe you see like your kid visiting his favorite cousin stay awhile and come home after awhile they might get the routine and look forward comung and going just hope her new and his dog don leave now that would hard for your dog joint custody tough see how your dog act when come back you make that happy reunion with treat and hug ,0

because one else ha answered will informative way can raw diet are not first line choice for most vet this because they are very very very hard not almost impossible balance from nutrition standpoint and raw meat contains bacteria such coli salmonella campylobacter and others which can infect your pet you animal seem much more tolerant bacteria but the bacteria shed the feces for day after ingestion and ha the potential infect people the house with the dog especially child and elderly the diet ha bone there increased risk foreign body intestinal blockage occurring all around much riskier diet compared kibble veterinary balanced home cooked diet the link below blog run veterinarian who specializes infectious disease cover many different disease like canine influenza but the link post done regarding raw food many people will tout the raw prey animal diet being closer what dog would eat naturally however dog and wolf are two very different specie thanks the process domestication dog haven been wild for very long time even husky and other arctic breed dog have gained amylase through domestication meaning they can digest starch also wolf don live very long the wild and hard life not sure why drawing comparison between actual predator and pampered family pet that want give the best life possible know there claim about allergy relief out there well but told human they were allergic all chicken and now they had eat only raw beef they look like wa crazy you allergic food you allergic the food not the preparation method sorry for the long winded answer just wanted provide much detail could answer your question ,0
boy must super chatty ❤️ ,0
like the camera idea but make sure ’ not just your backyard angle can catch the people further away who might have gun feel like neighbor would from their house window ,0
use treat get her move where want like get her jump would hold treat between finger place above her head and lift hand while saying once she jump give her the treat she got that pretty quickly for sit would move the treat over her head she have sit and look back for leave would hold open hand and tell her leave and moved away she tried take then said signal she can have ,0
\ breeds\ what breed are right for live the northeast and went with breeder ontario canada brought boy across the border when wa week you have fill out some paperwork through the cdc and agree quarantine your pup until day after their first rabies vaccine extra fee wa relatively straightforward process for and didn have any issue the border some canadian breeder are willing hold pup until week for customer avoid the cdc regulation you like more info you can send good luck finding your perfect poodle ,0
funnily enough lot old people know which grew without social medium internet all refer reading the newspaper this must some generational thing ,0
banjo type favorite type guess you could call him racy definitely leggy and lean the shoulder and standard call for the male ideal the breeder the supported entry show went all called him small but not almost ideal they used the big one guess bring out the wicket tbh the shoulder the perfect size pretty sure the huge toller exist because you need the dog otherwise large going meet height standard with the cddy mutation the one that come from cddy line but don have cddy end being like goldens size wonder the huge toller would come with the same similar breed distribution the relative result ,0
here channel that would recommend you really love his video and watch them teach dog different thing ,0
ha become issue with your roommate well the dog sound triangulated some how your scared your roommate dog your roommate should get her dog checked out find solution ,0
are you crazy just that until that situation resolved the authority wouldn leave dog outside principle ,0
take him the vet asap although fine with everything else maybe you accidentally scared him something recently and have rebuild trust with him not ill injured slowly try regain his trust perhaps sitting the floor kiiiind him but not too close and probably not looking him and let him come when ready eventually work some treat there too but cautious give treat right away because worried that compelling him something very uncomfortable doing ,0
hmm every dog different but may that your dog feeling little pressured the training nothing you are doing wrong any mean but sound like she little sensitive try shorter session set timer for minute and then stop also ramp the value the treat you are using generate some enthusiasm bit real chicken cheese see those two strategy help all ,0
border collie ,0
what breed some breed have more doggie smell than others ,0
when come back from out town both dog sniff and pee every seems like think that they are catching the news telling everybody that they are back town and posting scented photo all the meal that they ate vacation ,0
your vet indicated that your dog would eventually suffer ill effect including arthritis you didn get the surgery but because you aren personally witnessing this yet you not treating your dog for serious condition wrong please let know because otherwise what you doing self treating serious injury concerning ,0
this just because something doesn live long doesn mean they process time differently you mean when they hit maturity it based size and breed ,0
try using more impressive treat can really shorten training session with her because this point they last second also try change venue maybe training her law won scare her much thanks for the advice ,0
yeah when dog and come back home from vacation something spend like half hour going around our home block just going through the big mail backlog ,0

seriously wondered who overheard convos with dog and wrote this post love that all think alike ,0
not much exercise guess just uncomfortable with them being crate all day unable get out for walk pee drink etc the post wa referring wa big dog that smashed it way out cage essentially ,0
might have wait until next black friday sale but will ,0
inscentory ,0
dunno man next door neighbour had their dog chained all the time and looked like wa being mistreated say something that just example nothing with crating house etc ,0
understand but that story obviously separation anxiety and whole different beast dog doesn need eat sleep pee during the day whether crate not just sleep sometimes spin around and go back sleep and that the extent now with separation anxiety even more important crate them because they can seriously injure themselves they are left out their crate trying escape the house thats why crate training thing make the crate good place where they don have scared left dog out his cage for whole whole work and now crate him again one day got curious wa already strange enough that wa walking around during the day rarely doe that somehow got into the bathroom and ate entire bottle ibuprofen see why safer for him the crate dog have way getting into shit they aren supposed want dog happy and safe ,0
other people notice comment the smell mean dog have smell … could you more sensitive smell than some others notice you should probably head the vet figure out ,0
been saying that for year thank you for the tax ,0
what you mean clean this happening your place the yard something also your dog terrier terrier normally love dig hole and hide their rawhide pit mix used that they love digging inside then doing something similar digging like hiding placing where can find again ,0
that some kind pack behavior one the biggest dog your group may have nominated himself pack leader you can try putting him leash when new dog approach and maybe see how reacts try assure him somehow that okay and then let him off leash again you may have try messing around with those step see what happens ,0
most likely the stress being left alone and also the fact that only year old dog peed the house until wa about left alone and had him perfectly potty trained while were home would also pee the house had just moved new place there wa new piece furniture rug now year old can’ even remember the last time happened ,0
whole family all use wee mail ,0
man can even imagine how crippled dog would hadn had his tplos done seven year ago when tore his cruciates ,0
very interesting been curious see how this feature will develop dog mostly rat terrier maltese but all his relative are maltese guessing that maltese are much more inbred than rat terrier and this impact ,0

toy walk the morning and puzzle feeder would suggestion leave boy home for about thebsame amount time and ’ get minute walk the morning yard time while get dressed breakfast split between his dish and his puzzle ha three bed the house full run all the room except mine and boatload toy ’ never had issue yet and ’ caught him sleeping more than once get home few minute early mind you they learn your schedule and will probably act upset you’ late haha ,0
they mouthy all get out know yip let them know they hurt and get them toy play with instead and praise them for playing with the toy they still too young really learning this from you they should learning this mostly from their sibling honestly the only thing doing with puppy that young starting crate and potty training and working general exposure thing and sound ,0
should mentioned that she fixed spayed think happened right before got her because that area wa still shaved down short from the surgery good know normal wa hoping that after few play session she know hold like the other dog but have part routine which currently there isn much one the marking around parent house figured could also because she could smell other dog that have been there before also somewhat new the past few month that during walk she pee time just mark area wonder this part her marking place ,0
always say look checking his email lol ,0
love hound much more than lab unpopular opinion hound have much chill still need lot exercise and mental stimulation but imo sooo much easier train and manage they are loud though try train when then can and can bark howl early age example playing people outside the door car people coming talk walk bark barking for attention barking late night barking crate not bark ,0
right now isn much about training skill encouraging behavior getting multiple crate set and encouraging them spend time alone them they transition crate training more easily setting dedicated potty area encourage food potty manner help potty training etc exposing them variety sound smell and surface help cultivate confident puppy that doesn startle easily ,0
joke that the neighbor dog dog girlfriend when either them pee the fence between our yard say they are leaving love note for each other lol ,0
the same thing call checking his pee mail ,0
sure this question asked all the time but wa really hoping someone had some advice wife and really want rescue dog but both work full time and both have pretty long commute our schedule overlap bit but realistically dog would home 8ish hour daily which little more than most recommendation online the alternative appears get dog walker but unless misunderstand that per year doe anyone here manage this kind situation just not appropriate for get dog ,0

hopefully will into for the prey drive the last lab had had him leash trained trailing 20ft lead and tow lol ,0
hear what you saying make sad leave her the crate unfortunately it for her own safety well because she tends just eat anything part beagle maybe that why don want have worry about her having sharp wood shaving her stomach when she inevitably chew the window sill thinking she beagle shiba mix she can withstand decent amount cold unless it single digit windy take her out for hour the morning the problem she just really really like chew when home she hardly try chew what she shouldn but the minute she alone she doesn care about her toy any suggestion how work this would gladly spend the next few month working this but would need her have reliable chew when she alone exercise and mental stimulation just don cut for her don know why ,0

frankly that wishful thinking rottweiler and gsds are breed that many people get guard dog and just turn into understimulated neurotic reactive mess just this year someone family got gsd puppy because they cute like teddy bear then proceeded zero training and not care for them properly real fucking surprised they haven gotten rid now had way too many people trying tell their untrained rottweiler with zero manner boundary wa just big baby these are hugely popular breed that plenty people get for the wrong reason ,0
cool ’ definitely keep that mind option then thanks for the info ,0
jrl1fhibekc c77 cchpyu those video are more aimed older dog but should give you some good pointer lot patience the card though also know they focus treat reward which bit issue for pup young but even little drop something will the trick couple good other thing work focus slowly try push their limit what distraction you can surround them with and still have them respond your voice bonus point they also come similar focus but from time time separate one from the group but still able see them first and try get them focus you and not back towards their sibling they get more comfortable with this slowly increase both time and distance remember that socialisation isn just meeting other people dog but exposure all sort stimulus noise stuff like wind from fan different smell texture etc etc calming exercise that age just sort get them riled and then hold them and gently pat them until they settle hope that give you some idea you can get sit out them that would superb effort you manage get them hold that sit for more than couple second you are allowed assign yourself the rank super foster ,0

wa reading the other end the leash and even visual difference might scary are you suddenly wearing hat big jacket something covering you that may change the way you look ,0
this such cute comment ,0
know lot about raw but wa just simply asking which form raw they might feeding agree most people shouldn’ attempt because they would just screw the balance entirely ’ not for your every day pet owner unless they really take the time research and educate themselves ’ done raw and know maybe hundred others that have had their dog and cat fantastic with but ’ definitely not for every dog wa more wondering why wa being downvoted for simply asking wasn’ preaching the heaven about how anyone and everyone should feed would have deserved the downvotes that case haha ,0
just remind him that adopted ,0
everything turn out okay maybe you should the doctor afterwards there have been case where dog sniff out illness their owner and maybe concerned are you woman who could pregnant ,0

hmm interesting fwiw checked the haplotype sharing table table from that study 1247 30456 published last year genetic relationship and breed development 161 breed the one where they sorted them into clade and their finding the breed showing statistically significant haplotype sharing with toller were from most least sharing collie sheltie american cocker pug airedale lab flat coated and beardie many modern terrier that study showed evidence some pug ancestry ftr those finding too would tend support what that breeder wa saying they did tentatively place the toller the retriever clade the clade are based genetic distance measure rather than haplotype sharing ,0
many many pit owner have obsession with nurture nature and want try prove their pit are the friendliest thing the world and can never anything wrong they can accept the fact that their dog are dangerous and try convince people that they were nanny dog and that you have train dog fight ,0

’ sorry your neighbor did that ’ not sure why people think verbally abusing their neighbor help create pleasant atmosphere live also live neighborhood without side walk and people routinely walk their dog the edge the lawn hardly think you were doing something egregious that said that’ pretty over the too response from the neighbor you’ probably save yourself headache walking the other side the street ,0
nature’ miracle soak that stain pouring not just merely spraying let soak for awhile cause there’ enzyme that break down the animal protein which cause the smell get roll white paper towel now the hard part press down and let the liquid soak back into towel keep changing towel until there more yellow coming back surface don’ scrub you are trying bring the surface all the liquid not forcing back down once that done let air dry give the sniff test still smell retreat again ala the stain might not ever gone but the odor should definitely gone ’ poured that stuff wooden floor let soak and more smell and yes spend the for high quality thick mattress cover wash and bleach every month that will save your investment more than anything else you can think ,0
thank you for doing this ,0
think small probably female standard poodle would everything you want they are really lovely dog lagottos know le about but from what read they would fit the bill well ,0
would this type breeder the right place look for say running and hiking companion who ahem might also easygoing enough cohabit with sometimes crabby acd mix for some reason they seem the single most likely breed for luna hit off with which doe make interested them but there also seems subset them who tend approach greet challenging pushy way and that doesn over well with her all haven been able determine whether this ha any relationship line just purely individual thing such that any easygoing adult rescue gsd might smarter bet despite the health unknown ,0
everyone healthy that not the issue ignore him when whine put him room himself simply ignoring him doesn work let him out give him love when calm down ,0
want show just about the border collie lol ,0

course don know and you don either that doesn change the fact that the whole crate den cliché based misunderstanding and faulty analogy—not science not magical insight into the subjective experience dog know many thing that suggest that the crate den spiel shaky including for example wolf don actually spend much time den people once believed den contrast closed crate ha exit route and the ability exit leave move away often important animal animal den isn’ visible others and that part den’ appeal whereas dog conventional wire crate fully exposed and again you completely utterly misunderstood point which that crate training indeed like training dog for “being pet picked examined stopped anything they don want ” ’ something you can condition dog tolerate ’ something for our convenience and for their health and safety but closed crate not like den not against crate training though think crate can overused and misused just think that people should stop mindlessly parroting this dumbass argument support ,0

hmm rhu ha been trusted loose night for month but she very much pleaser have doubt she better behaved when home even sleeping plus the worst happened and she went after the cat woken the noise easier trust that way yeah think rhubarb would notice that been gone longer than usual the light changing hearing our neighbor coming home and taking their dog out think our advantage that regard don have lot rigidity our routine sometimes home first sometimes and not back until much later she much le expectant arriving with set environmental cue and honestly rhu the same term lounging around even when home only worried about anxiety not the boredom side ,0

car sickness super common puppy sometimes they grow out sometimes they don’ sometimes they grow out but can still associate being the car with being sick which very difficult association break only bring him long trip when you absolutely have too try short drive where doesn’ get ill and help him associate the car with good thing increasing his time each time able handle the distance without getting sick will take treat the car mine often too nervous this also highly recommend doggie seat belt other kind car restraint car appropriate crate not only keep them safe and restrained but can reduce the car sickness feeling they get from being bounced around make them feel more secure addition the car seat cover that are hammock style have proven really helpful for guy just another security blanket make his ride more positive and protect seat from potential vomit prefer the hammock style because give them contained space and doesn’ allow their foot slip off the seat which can unnerving for lot dog good luck ,0

how old the puppy question you haven’ given lot information but sound like you have young dog who resource guarding and barely ever get taken for walk did you socialize her properly young dog other dog not the one home people and different place resource guarding why she bite you over food first please get trainer when you feed your dog you should feeding her far away from all other dog like different room with the door closed there great book called ‘mine’ which all about resource guarding and will help you while you work with trainer this issue while you work your dog need feel safe and comfortable around her food that’ why separate room advisable secondly you need taking your puppy for age and breed specific exercise out your backyard daily that mean your dog month old husky your looking something like daily running and walking you have month old chihuahua something like 45min daily walking sniffing outdoors but think there lot more going here and trainer could really benefit you ,0
sound like the dog ha resource guarding issue discipline and ‘being charge’ will only make that worse need exercise their dog properly and counter condition the dog around food and others ,0
just what wife did and slowly show with more and more animal everyday lol ,0

one friend went through this with her german shepherd mix pup but waited training until she wa year old she sent her one the training camp where they take the dog for week train all the issue out and then for year two year come back each week into your home and teach you how the pack leader all the dog issue were gone wa really beneficial and highly recommend wa 500 for all that training the home training included seems like maybe this something you should take into consideration this young dog that you can’ control and biting hard will need not only guarding training pack leader training but also might need learn “soft mouth” which really difficult for the lay person train ’ say even you don’ doggie boot camp take this one professional ,0

not sure what specific breed puppy you looking for but probably pretty safe say that you looking largely byb that their model and many these breeder are pushing you either looking the wrong place for breeder that breed designer mix where all the breeder are sketchy would not trust breeder who trying push pyramid scheme disguise somehow benefitting the dog they only stand their dog their dog are fed something specific that lack scientific evidence that then they probably don actually stand their dog all which speaks bigger problem ,0

don’ want sound cruel but can’ there anyone you can “trade” walking duty with like they the day you can’ and you walk theirs the you are home some other sort barter thats all can think the dog just really ha walked least once each hour period not twice ,0

call animal control your neighbor going need contain their dog they are aggressive ,0
still not sure they will able overcome their weakness poop being out ocd very serious issue sort like counting the number step you take when walking down stair reading and rereading thing multiple time etc ,0
call animal control the local police you have none like you should have the first time ,0
ideally you need talk with your neighbor and let them know what ha happened the past and what happening now they don know there problem and they deserve opportunity solve they can won control confine their dog you need contact the appropriate authority you call your mayor office and speak their constituent service department they can guide you who the right person department would assuming your community ha law about loose dog ,0
speaking ill the dead make you asshole real life just you know ,0
you need tell your neighbor about both incident asap and help them come with way keep their dog off your property they don’ can’ then you will sadly have involve animal control you probably should tell animal control already but since you seem want extra nice the old couple this about the best you can ,0
most ecollars shock collar have vibrate button ’ happy recommend brand however ’ never seen with “increasing” vibration that’ where the “electric” part come into play and most people use shock ’ kind curious why you think non painful uncomfortable stimulus will get his attention when your voice touch will not ’ yet meet dog where vibrate with training produce any change behavior ’ typically used cue for when your dog out earshot but your dog right next you you’ definitely done your due diligence and tried fix this force free way wouldn’ fault you all for looking aversive tool help regain some control and composure however ’ suggest seeking out the help balanced trainer not just buying collar and trying out ,0

look for dog loving retiree your dog easy dog walk maybe high school student who want make few buck week doing something they enjoy good luck ,0
lot dog find vibrate more aversive than stim can tell you why but something personally seen hesitant recommend you looking for interrupter maybe consider something sound based first like take whistle even the dog one that are pitch can hear with you something novel and try that out initially follow through with redirect once you have his attention far recommendation don cheap out any collar like that stick the big player like etech dogtra sportdog etc you get what you pay for also please consider working with decent lima trainer who support least know how overlay type training collar you need have dog wear without using the button for week they don get collar wise teach the dog how turn the vibrate stim tone whatever and off usually done overlaying with leash pressure fwiw started using ecollar gsd who ha frustration excitement reactivity after few year work making bigger stride and hasn all had negative fall out but been extremely cautious use ,0
agree ,0
before considering sending this dog back shelter really think about how much success they are going have rehoming this dog you’ the most place are exploding with adoptable dog most whom have never bitten person ’ very likely the dog will sit shelter for month year before ultimately being euthanized ’ much rather have dog pas surrounded people that love him versus the shelter alternative when there’ little chance finding suitable home ,0
humane murder what this really mean sort like another hot button topic people talk about but will never call real name the trainer while likely good their job wa playing hard ball glad the owner sought second opinion because there always choice make other than killing something however she cannot gone often she and expect the dog behavior problem resolve matter the training dog like that need run jump climb chase socialized and tired not currently getting that ,0

there’ nothing anyone can say make you feel better matter what you will have experience the pain endure and come out the other side knowing your heart that the dog lived her best life she wa loved completely and she gave her love right back appreciate the time you still have with her had childhood dog who lived till she wa putting her down wa the hardest thing ever had experience the same time even though she wa alive she had zero quality life and try keep that mind when looking back that know there’ nothing that will soothe this pain for you but hopefully this can help you gain perspective ,0

think been echoed several time that you need contact animal control but throw hat with that group well when these incident occurred were your dog under observation human were they just your property and the attack happened moving forward would not leave the dog out unattended this something you have been doing consider fencing off portion your property give your dog safe containment space that keep other danger away from them fence work both keep thing well out carry some type easily accessible deterrent the citronella spray work well from what understand with you whenever you are out with your dog case this dog come back any other dog make appearance ,0

wouldn worry about not eating previously she wa probably more food motivated because based her background she wa likely lot more scavenger her previous life and food wa never guaranteed she now understands that food will come regularly and always the same thing instead eating just because now she just eats when she hungry dog the same way just free feed her now some day she hardly eats anything some day she eats lot course she love treat because those are novel and interesting like the difference between eating the healthy food cook home and going out eat eating junk food when you eat your healthy home food kibble because you hungry most people don eat salad just for the sake eating when you eating junk food you might not hungry all but you eat because taste good same idea far playing maybe she doesn know how and maybe she just ha different play style sound like for her going for walk and run with you the most enjoyable activity sometimes she feel like being social with other dog sometimes she doesn that fine just like not all human enjoy the same hobby not all dog are super into toy not all dog enjoy playing fetch mine doesn know she understands the concept because she crazy smart and learns easily from other dog but she refuse play sometimes she like chasing after ball thrown but she doesn bring back she run off and lay down and chew for dog chewing how she play her favourite game destroying soft toy bonus point ha squeaker she can find and obliterate sometimes she throw and shake the toy around and sometimes she play tug war with you but for the most part she just chew and happy clam that way wrecking stuff cool game for her have you tried other way playing beyond throwing ball tug war flirt pole etc not would encourage you keep trying but otherwise none this sound bad really don think you sound like bad dog parent all seems like you doing just fine and can take long time for dog really come out their shell too say took about full year before really started understand the full depth dog personality that just they have personality course you don want anthropomorphize your dog too much but also understand that just like people they have different personality and like dislike not all dog are going play the same behave the same way this and pup hike the summer you interested gotta pay that puppy tax lol fwiw she come from pretty similar background just farther north rescued from rural area somewhere saskatchewan most likely reservation ,0

awesome good for you for doing your research beforehand and choosing reputable breeder few thing can think the puppy blue are real and you may experience them ’ period time feeling down unsure your choice get puppy lot this ha with the sudden overwhelming responsibility because really patient and remember your puppy literally baby even when you’ taught them some command and expect them know better remind yourself they are baby they truly don’ know better but they will continue learn you train them clicker training ha worked super well for the puppy ’ had gave this advice once this sub and had great feedback potty training used this method most recent puppy and wa relatively potty trained week anytime took him outdoors wa for potty took him out told him potty and didn’ then wa right back inside did would praise him and give him treat obviously there wa outdoor playtime and walk mixed into that but point teaching them associate outside with potty crate train from the very start ’ extremely difficult crate train adolescence 6mo truly suck this where you need make sure they know they are not pack leader most dog will test your limit this age consider your breed and give them what they need dog husky german shepherd and ’ learned need work satisfied advanced working dog training class that started around month and will take him weekly for life don’ afraid ongoing training class thankful decided this and our dog extremely obedient and time happier than would didn’ give him work many breeder are available you for the rest your dog life don’ afraid keep touch with them reach out you have concern question best luck dog are the best ,0
boxer could totally box but otherwise unsimilar ,0
awesome glad see you have vet appointment set definitely mention the drooling and how impact his quality life only mention not punishing because well meaning people out and will hire trainer without knowing the method they use and some trainer will recommend thing like shock collar spraying the dog the crate which will definitely make thing worse good see that you haven’ been trying punish the behavior out yes behaviorist are expensive but some people will waste money going from trainer trainer with progress when they could have gone behaviorist right away and saved some money also keep mind that the dog training field unregulated any joe scmoe down the street can call themselves behaviorist which why recommended veterinary behaviorist they have degree vet medicine and can prescribe medication which why recommended one but the very least try find behaviorist who ha certification and degree but the expense will worth your dog young and the earlier you intervene the easier time you will have modifying the behavior separation anxiety particularly tricky behavior modify because aren’ there when the behavior occurs also don’ feel like ’ your fault lot serious anxiety have genetic component too and even you did everything exactly right your dog still could have ended with separation anxiety all that matter you are trying help your dog the most comfortable can and you are trying solve ,0

did read few book before asking learned that ’ inborn instinct because dog like chasing thing that move ’ wonder why ’ commonly advocated calm down and use strong body language deter these chase you start shaking and move anxiously you’ resemble the prey used activate their born prey reflex that’ the gist what wrote what you think what else should add based the way explained and typed out ’ very hard understand ’ looking got the basic concept down furthermore will add further research any new concept mentioned the comment here interest ,0

maybe x200b ,0
you plan taking this with your landlord more you should would look your lease and what anything say about dog had dog since started living own and out the half dozen place rented every one ha had pet addendum some sort and specifically detail the dog not cause any harm also would try catch any other dog owner the building and see they have had incident well because there always power number many have said document any further incident and keep all evidence you have past one report anything you have animal control your city doe not have one then report the police non emergency format depending how much time ha passed they might not able much about the past incident but give credibility future report keep that documentation for while because anything go court you won shorthanded the owner responsible for their dog their dog comfort not above your dog safety plain and simple esa not aggressive dog owner need held accountable ,0

hey hope you can forgive the length this reply got bit carried away there the end x200b sound like your parent are the right track they know what kind dog they like and what they aren’ looking for – those are always the best step start with x200b opinion yorkies are excellent breed for older people this breed very smart and friendly most them that have personally met are definitely the velcro snuggle type that your parent seem prefer however the downside this breed can often overprotective they will bark and yap and may take extra training keep this behavior bay yorkies are not always suitable for home with small child – your parent’ case this seems fine they can also have problem with other dog would wise introduce them any breed for that matter your pom and any other dog carefully and make sure they have ample socialization throughout their life yorkies sometimes have trouble getting used stranger socialization key with any breed all the yorkies have ever met have been raving attention hog who absolutely adore their owner this breed sound very likely fit your parent’ want x200b mini schnauzer are hardy breed for being small mini schnauzer are very intelligent and not often aggressive breed however the breed sometimes ha territorial nature and will bark warn you they are bit more independent than some other breed though they are still friendly breed they have some grooming upkeep that considered mini schnauzer are great alternative other terrier breed because while they are very similar their temperament often much more laid back however they have high prey drive that common terrier type breed despite this mini schnauzer are amazingly adaptable breed x200b westies are loyal breed though sometimes independent too they are known highly social they are very friendly sparky breed they are energetic and inquisitive however notable that even within the breed there temperament variation terrier they have many the typical terrier trait they are barker and known dig your parent like westies would also suggest they also look into cairn terrier x200b your parent could also consider dachshund they might enjoy the wire haired variety extremely snuggly breed though they can excitable too dachshund are extremely loyal their owner and very humorous companion every dachshund met ha been just absolutely stuck their owner that special velcro dog kind way they love bury under blanket and snuggle however they have some common setback such barking and can sometimes aggressive other dog and stranger training key this definitely dog that you would want research reputable breeder dachshund without the proper training are often little terror x200b wire fox terrier are most likely not the best option because their high energy and prey drive they are very demanding breed wire fox can exciting and friendly breed however because their high prey drive they are notoriously difficult control this not breed that could off leash for any extended period time they have very normal behavior selective listening and destructive behavior related their prey drive x200b imo terrier particularly those with high prey drive are not great fit for your parent however they are willing work hard and compromise would suggest that looking into terrier option still viable with any terrier breed you will have watch out for high prey drive these breed were bred for this and such are often not the right choice keep off leash for the safety the dog with the right amount supervision and redirection prey drive can manageable however doe not sound like the ideal situation for your parent however there are few terrier breed that may interest your parent they are set terrier for their next dog x200b border terrier are one such breed that may interest they are another very loyal breed though are sometimes known have will their own they are very adaptable friendly breed terrier they will still have that instinct chase thing border can territorial their home but are not known aggressive breed they are often laid back and love around their people and relax x200b norfolk and norwich terrier these are two very similar breed that have similar disposition they are great household dog and joy around they have that terrier liveliness without nearly much the excitability norfolk can independent but more often than not love people they are breed that highly enjoys human company breed used pack norfolk often get along well with other dog and are not aggressive breed they are known love people and make good pet even home with child they are not vocal breed but will bark due their territorial tendency norwich the other hand are energetic affectionate dog they are not known aggressive shy but they can sometimes get bossy especially with other dog like norfolk they will warn stranger norwich are generally good with other pet with any dog especially those with high prey drive they should watched carefully around small creature they may decide they are prey x200b would never suggest having any dog off leash open area for any extended period time matter their temperament only very rare case would this okay and often only with dog with extensive training x200b looking into reputable breeder for the right dog great step towards getting the right dog for their personal need breeder are extremely knowledgeable and will able tell dog right for the owner and will know how place dog with home that fit x200b your parent are looking into specific breed have them try find and meet nearby breeder most breeder love show off their dog and talk about their breed being able meet dog from the breed they are interested will give your parent better understanding what they are getting into with particular breed see nearby breeder will let you come and meet their dog this one the best way know how get know breed personally local dog show are also great way meet dog breeder and dog owner x200b they look into shelter dog make sure meet with them multiple time different environment possible too many new owner get surprise when their dog personality come out after the transition home life and sometimes are not prepared handle such situation mixed breed shelter dog are always mystery temperament wise meeting with the dog multiple time and learning about them and how they personally react thing may help acclimate owner the dog and see they are the right fit shelter will also give approximate guess dog’ breed this will help when researching possible behavior and temperament that may apply that dog another possibility look into foster adopt program with local shelter they aren’ sure yet x200b always keep mind that while breed have standard temperament there still variation within that and there are always outlier every breed each dog individual with their own personality and will adapt react situation differently however temperament something that usually more ingrained the makeup the general breed research key and the best research sometimes get out there and meet the dog breed person form your own opinion x200b also sure look into health issue related any breed your parent decide some breed are prone many issue while this doesn’ guarantee they will apply your dog always good idea watch for these thing and aware them just case x200b yorkies and mini schnauzer sound great for your parent terrier are not the best idea unless your parent are willing put more work into training visit breeder meet different breed and form your own opinion breeder are invaluable resource learn about the breed and give advice what right for your household you adopt from shelter visit the dog much you can and try see how the dog act outside the shelter environment fostering also viable option with shelter dog shelter dog are definitely more case case basis ,0

fair dog breeder handler are kind nutty cult not always but mean they often advocate leaving certain breed outside overnight the winter make their coat grow thicker they put the dog through lot stress and are the one breeding dog for show look rather than health and ’ heard some get big discount purina pro plan guess because big dog show are usually sponsored purina someone just getting into that world hears the previous winner are all purina proplan “coincidentally” than they’ probably put their dog well that said don’ think purina evil like lot people for some reason think proplan and one are very good dog food ’ perfectly balanced food lot different formula meet your dog specific need they have meat the first ingredient which important lot people and you said they put lot research into these food and must taste damn good because ’ literally the only kibble dog will eat dry people think they’ feeding their dog healthier just because the ingredient list ha potato instead rice and pea instead corn because ha fruit veggie yet ’ still pummeled down cooked high temperature and end tiny brown piece there’ literally going difference between dog food that us say spinach iron source one that just add iron vitamin except the cost and the fact that the supplement way more reliable and precise all these people wanting “nutritionists” claiming actual professional dietitian are wrong like people who dismiss doctor for their holistic “medicine” that wa rant just really grind gear lol ,0

don disagree that there are definitely some nutty thing the show world but when talking about breed where look trump health you far from standard poodle they one the healthiest breed and the breed club particular about health when see these line standard that have clear health for generation and find out they have been consistently feeding purina not going brush that aside also considering how nutty show dog people any dog people really are the fact that many can agree something particular nutrition pretty mind blowing but also agree that for the most part dog food dog food trust dog food that been through more based research and requirement well feeding trial but long you monitoring health most any aafco food will provide your dog with what need will mostly always recommend purina royal canin and hill because they the more tried true and tested brand brand that make food for the general population dog well for particular case but that doesn mean think people are harming their dog picking different aafco approved food definitely baffle when people try dismiss research from company because company are bad but also want ignore that the research done company like purina the research other company end using make their own food have puppy food because purina are they going stop feeding their puppy puppy food because wa purina who researched the particular need puppy ,0

done however bit disappointed that you can choose what breed mix your dog because there one hell difference between owning papillon mix and gsd rottweiler cross and speaking cross why isn crossbreed possible answer not uncommon for dog bred solely for working competitive ability cross between two different breed also think that something like had them since they were born bred them myself should option for how people got their dog because while current dog came from somebody else pretty much all family dog came from our own bloodline and know some people who either have their own bloodline well took pregnant bitch and kept least one the puppy ,0

put your dog leash grab some treat and recreate the situation but now with you control teach your dog how you expect him behave depending how excited your pup get you may have start off light but basically use treat keep the dog attention off chasing the ball teach him calm when your kid are playing not with him you can decide what the chasing fine but the jumping isn you can use the leash stop control the behavior you looking for and the treat reinforce the behavior you want dog run toward kid leash gently stop dog from jumping running calm the dog sit down even just calm stand fine and treat try keep giving treat while the dog calm and watching ignoring while your kid play this will take multiple training session but over time your dog and poodle are smart will eventually understand the rule and over time you can hopefully stop using the leash training however the meantime the kid want play like that just put your dog elsewhere use the leash until the dog ha learned calm around this type behavior hope that make sense tldr use leash and treat train the dog the behavior you want ,0

you never used remote collar shock collar you may overblowing how intense have tried mine hand all setting even though only use the lower few with dog the shock really more tingle low setting weird sensation but not unpleasant you can even feel all you turn get uncomfortable but not painful the max setting like static shock you would get touching door knob also agree with others that vibrate actually may more annoying distracting uncomfortable for your dog than the lower stock level ,0

yep but might easier said than done don know your dog most importantly find appropriate threshold work from maybe your pup can handle your kid playing speed but not 100 maybe distance thing 10ft but not whatever the case that where you start pick the appropriate situation where your dog can easily calm and build from there keep training session short and don try achieve too much one session your dog start reacting the play and longer interested the treat can calm you gone too far too fast back and slow down good luck ,0
you’ really bad this whole reading thing aren’ you ,0
would start teaching your dog some manner when come fetch start game fetch with him but don give him the ball until ha all four foot the ground and give you respectful space jumping you hovering then make him back and wait with all four foot the ground until you throw the ball then you can teach the kid his new manner would also work teaching him leave thing that aren his alone want play with something that isn his tell him then give him one his toy play with dog used love playing with cat toy she ha learned when say not yours that that not her toy play with ,0
that the dog might possibly rehabilitated some circumstance where the owner ha thousand dollar can quit their job live the wood whatever irrelevant unless the owner actually ha capacity and can keep everyone safe the meantime the responsibility the owner not cause the dog pain trauma and try within their mean and keep the dog from biting others those are the responsibility any way they are met responsible including putting the dog down but this circumstance they have tried two trainer there are multiple people living tight quarter with this dog which current danger and one who love with can exercise much le socialize don know the owner budget the owner want keep trainer shopping they can but they have responsibility the roommate guest and the dog itself far quality life rehoming not ethical option taking the dog shelter not ethical option not saying euthanasia necessarily their only option but they should certainly not told cruel off the table irresponsible ,0

this proof that almost all dog food are the same issue like this would have begin the supplier certain part the dog food being produced could the same manufacturer food sold under different brand ,0
understand this dog forum but too often here people say the kid fault blame the kid train the kid however there are situation like this where the dog should trained not jump anyone period there can kid ball and dog all once dog can trained sit stay and command thus the issue jumping would negated the dog wa taught restraint when playing fetch usually when kid ha toy and trying keep from the dog they aren playing keep away they are simply trying keep the dog from stealing toy that they are playing with train restrain with dog prior feeding fetching getting the car coming the house playing with kid there have been incident where they play tag much dog and human can where knocked kid over mistake but isn because the dog wa too excitable the kid bashing here need end this post prime example why need end instead addressing the behavior the dog you assume the kid shouldn have ball while the dog around newsflash dog the dog doe not take precedence over developing child anything the training the dog sit stay and calm prior throwing the ball could help the kid learn thing about dog behavior x200b ,0
won’ ever change just wasting your breathe ,0
they mention why they want aussie are there any characteristic that they like beside that they cute you course already recognize that not reason get dog but maybe they could find lower energy dog with some the characteristic they like about aussie ,0
and should probably provide some context case you not familiar with this type training and you want learn more feel free ignore this but just felt previous post lack lot context about this style training here you this referred classic conditioning counter conditioning think pavlov under the positive reinforcement umbrella training other similar technique are look that engage disengage training and also worth looking into your choice training where you teach your dog self impulse control you looking for more detailed information about how train this method start there also though your dog isn really considered reactive dog based how most people define the training the same most dog classified reactive are dog that bark lunge crazy for various reason which this particular scenario would fall under that umbrella but you probably wouldn actually classify your dog such that being said the reactivedogs community ha wealth information this type training getting dog calm the face stressor stimulant you can learn ton about this type positive reinforcement training there you looking for more detail you can use this type training for all sort behavior modification variety situation and lastly when come treat smaller better you want something your dog doesn need chew and also won get fat from all the training this usually piece whatever about the size your small pinky fingernail the tastier the better ,0
personally ’ let doggo house and then text call neighbour friend saying the dog there would also mention them person that the dog out late night ’ letting house one kelpy will often disappear neighbour visit them and there jack russell often pop round can see fire going live farm there are fence just send each other message saying and dog here ,0
regardless what others may say here the kid not the problem work with your dog sit stay and when playing fetch will process calm the excitement but jumping people isn good dog behavior once you can get the dog sit habit when someone ha ball the jumping shouldn issue they will simply sit and wait for you throw the ball and tell them take repetition but crucial command series have when you have kid and toy ,0
wait you saying that shouldn have kid playing with their own toy the kid toy not the dog the dog need trained sit and stay when playing fetch avoid the jumping channel the energy into focused state prior throwing the ball once the kid ha ball the dog won jump but will sit and wait for the ball thrown ,0
best response this post glad there wa kid bashing this one ,0
just started making own dog food month ago definitely worth the cost effort ,0
the busy buddy squirrel dude more challenging slightly smaller hole and there are little rubber prong that make harder which you can cut off too difficult moisten kibble with warm water mix with some canned food really stuff the kong’ full pushing down there with finger them freeze for hr ’ got very persistent dog and they’ usually last for min hour ,0
newsflash dog aren’ computer where you download the “sit stay” command you need this thing called management order give yourself time train anything part training consistency which small child are historically horrible component one kid bashing owning dog system understanding how train manage and pick your battle this prime example how people don’ understand how manage their home “the dog know isn’ his ball” well clearly doesn’ continually going for the ball people come this forum time and time again saying “ dog know ” when their problem boil down their dog know nothing the situation and their expectation are out line with reality ,0
dog booty ,0
also struggled with leash reactivity with younger dog for her everything and everyone playmate when dog bark her she think ’ play time and start jumping and doe some twist and turn and howl and yelp like crazy ’ funny watch wasn’ happening first felt mad the other owner who would have dog barking and yelping and going crazy wa having hard time controlling dog and wa like they didn’ care all would take dog away and walk that would avoid barky dog then realized that those dog are actually really good training aid for mine yes wa hard first that time pup wa 55lb husky she could pull and drag around like weighed nothing she also had this very bad habit escaping any leash harness that put her wa hard changing point view helped lot though instead getting mad other dog and owner focused training dog ignore them and keep going lot treat calming technique reinforcing command etc took month but now can pas yappy dog and she wouldn’ care only time she’ reactive now when she see “dog friend” she go nut and want play immediately still working with her that one guess only word encouragement for you keep training yes you’ look like fool with super reactive dog right now guess what later wont like that anymore keep and you’ get enjoy your walk again will also help you keep the same route every walk during training ’ get really old really fast for your dog having the same dog barking her ,0
think european are also more respectful when come other people’ dog public not squeeling and trying pet dog without asking where live there’ barely anywhere you can take your dog unless ’ dog park just outside some place allow dog patio but then other people don’ like that lot people here also really seem dislike dog are afraid them unless the dog weighs le than lb ,0
sorry but when you respond with the dog isn the problem the kid the problem here that there way train your dog who very much like musician learning play new piece music computer bad analogy calm you associate calmness not with your body language but with the ball the ball used play fetch get the ball the dog must sitting get the ball the dog must stay once the ball thrown get the ball the dog must when given the command these are all step that can built the process training the dog not excited any ball that any one holding they can bring you ball should they want play fetch drop your foot and sit wait for you pick the ball the association the behavior ha with the ball not the person throwing the ball that why stated that involving the kid the training which would take some time could helpful for both the kid and the ball small child are historically horrible component consistency prime example your belief that child are more blame than dog the kid isn putting her face the dog face the kid playing with one their toy this bad dog behavior you can train the sit command day you can embed week however this dog doesn know sit and stay this age then the owner ha whole other issue ,0
they’ extremely trainable think training lifelong and doesn’ just stop because dog reach certain age once the puppy ’ adolescent phase ’ going much harder train but that just mean you double down and keep ,0
how you you have recipe you can share ,0
these brand probably all contracted their production out single supplier that made and packaged the food for them they probably had issue with their vitamin supplementation process someone didn the math right wa higher potency than should have been this doesn mean that all those food are the same the supplier will make the dog food according order brand can order food with expensive high quality specific ingredient cheap food with cheap ingredient that vary from batch batch depending current market price same factory ,0
sound more like relationship problem than dog problem your partner not willing listen your concern not sure what more you can convince them they already set aussie sound like you not completely set taking care dog and would make clear that you expect for your partner the primary caretaker and that she ha the one who ha care for the dog 100 perhaps your partner under the impression that you both will take care the dog she feel like doesn have all the work there changing your partner mind would look into aussie rescue that check their dog temperament and can match you with low energy senior aussie ,0
that quite annoying dog isn reactive but get little nervous when she hears barking even it from dog inside the house doe make walk quite bit more difficult can only imagine how frustrating that for you that being said know that some not well off neighborhood barking dog yard are great way fend off unwanted visitor and are generally used for safety don want assume where you live but maybe take that into consideration you pretty safe area however then think that people should definitely doing more mitigate their dog from barking regardless that dude and his property were obviously not danger and could have easily helped you calling off his dog thats just being dbag his part ,0
and take some extra bag the walk also encourage her drink lot that all possible help all the dry food it journey through her body wouldn worried about the dog health though these thing happen ,0
yes thank you all advice that agree with wa mistake trust anything that the breeder say far ’ concerned wa very irresponsible breeder she breed dog breed and cat under one household although ’ hesitant reintegrating the crate for the record ’ not exactly crate ’ pen that’ rather large and ha tray this moment want make sure everyone board with how properly use the crate unfortunately feel like ’ shown our poor pup that the crate bad place which the exact opposite what ’ supposed ,0
fiber make toot ’ say ’ the increase that ,0
meant say better keep the dog away from the kid and toy guessing from the size the dog and the dog knock the child over the kid under the age and still can comprehend the dog see the toy and think own agree dog need trained but start this easy problem temporarily fix until training can get accomplished ,0

that sound actually like great idea maybe start her off with comfy dog bed unused blanket and pillow and slowly reintroduce her the crate when she about month old what breed your puppy and how big she now this will give better estimate how better may give her puppy pad inside for the meantime you can take her outside often ,0
vet nurse here you have really careful you are doing correctly you have get every single component that dog need correct which incredibly difficult even thing down magnesium crude ash etc have correct isn’ just about protein and veg content any imbalance home made food will cause issue your dog down the line good your for doing your own food just hope you’ getting right and that doggy isn’ deficient anything ,0
supply chain professional with aware how the process sourcing work ingredient generally won vary batch batch the same ingredient will used written but they likely use different part whatever protein based they are using wouldn believe that market price matter well considering most brand likely contract with manufacturer make specific formulation over specified period time for specified price this reduces cost ensures product availability reduces inventory and level demand for the supplier assumed that the issue likely began tier two three supplier who feed the product derived demand the next supplier the manufacturer directly imagine most brand likely stamp their name the product and then then the product moved distributor from which retailer place their order ,0
everyone seems have this covered for you comment that the impending extra large dump probably going express her anal gland for you which great ,0
what country state are you writing from you need stop being nice that gsd still puppy and already being that aggressive and not being corrected then only going get nastier still growing into own foot there will likely come point when you nor the owner will able manhandle that dog you need contact animal control and begin filing report every single time there incident you should also email your landlord and complain about the aggression officially and often don phone using certified mail email and make copy every single time there attack you get cornered growled dealing with something similar with own apartment complex but not with dog that dangerous gsd how long ago wa the dog bite the store honestly wasn that long ago doesn hurt still ahead and report can almost promise you that she using the esa excuse because the landlord ha probably already said something she feel that something will said and she went and did some internet research find out how force the landlord let her keep the dog the good news esa rule not cover aggressive unruly destructive dog x200b ,0
this what would like happen however said neighbor ha been very hostile towards lately the extent that they made grievance tell the landlord effort get kicked out she ha screamed more than one occasion she also cannot contacted reliably have number for her but most the time her child ha that phone and aren supposed contact the child because their anxiety disorder when she doe have the phone she doesn keep her and doesn hear the ringer only other thought wa leave note the door but again aren supposed approach their house set foot their property because child anxiety disorder ,0
sorry should put quick ordered some but they won here until next week could lightly wrapping the paw with baby sock and baggy ghetto quick solution and way get them used foot thing ,0
very much like raising kid give inch they take mile you can give especially with dog because you can communicate why you have given just this one time and why won happen again you must remain steadfast tedious the training required but well worthwhile x200b little more complex then shortened version event but the process will the same teach the dog the sit command once you have that down teach them stay you will have let them stay for half second and work your way from there once you get threshold time you like you can began refusing the treat they not stay until you call them call with the word end the stay command this follows logically and becomes part the series well this during feeding time begin and then move into other area such fetch going outside coming inside getting the car getting out the car treat when kid have toy have also taught month old how play fetch with the dog know which ball the dog and will throw the ball when tell him the dog get and drop his foot any rate once you move along and the dog ha the series down move playing fetch you will have start all over albeit faster pace not ever throw the ball before the dog sits then once you repeat that enough not have give the sit command move stay easier use treat clicker signal the stay command what you seeking but have them stay when you throw the ball tricky and perhaps have helper hold the dog gently sitting position once you say the person can release the dog repeat this time until the dog longer need held then repeat more time without holding the dog once the dog ha the command down see you can involve your kid that the dog can associate the command with the ball and not necessarily the person you can rep this stuff pretty much forever just ingrain the process their mind you can supplement these command fetch along with down you holding something the dog want never give the dog the dog jump don ever reward behavior you don want caving because you annoyed because you know that the dog will stop you just give what they are after once the dog quits jumping you may give them what they want ,0

there’ still specific thing animal will need the wild dog are very different from wild animal let’ say wolf for example even though people think they’ incredibly similar the few difference their dna can mean they thrive totally different diet wolf will still have certain food ’ eat because they’ rich macronutrients and micro nutrient wild wolf will also eat what can survive but eats certain prey that prey may have nutritional deficit wolf may have distant deficient issue and don’ know because don’ care for them like dog and don’ take them the vet dog are domestic they really are not like wolf all contrary what people think have bred dog have certain distant requirement that suit human being dog will have lesser protein requirement than wolf dog digestive system are despite what raw feeder say different wolf yes they can digest raw meat well but their body are mainly been made and bred live off complete kibble food your labrador ha different distant requirement grey wolf because they’ been bred that way dog are more likely have distant deficiency picked because are around them all the time and observe canine behaviour and take them the vet get them diagnosed hope this sort shed light what you said ,0

yeah good point and massive amount people think vet are just corporate shill for selling and pushing those tried and trusted brand you listed that they 100 know provides your dog with correct nutrition and won’ make your dog sick ’ seen people with sick dog have their vet put their dog prescription diet the owner say cleared all symptom but they treat like antibiotic something and soon the dog feel better they immediately try wean their dog back onto some boutique dog food thats definitely not aafco approved “because science diet garbage” ’ sad with grain free now being correlated with heart failure had vet gone with that fad would not trust any vet who pushed that with the trend rather than decade science based research would absurd exactly thankfully think people are starting see these thing light the recent heart disease thing ,0
not sure you mean because you feed your dog kibble and bit not though you should stop they have their own problem dog food ,0
difficult find proper scientific research you don have journal account the best you can usually get abstract that doesn give you real picture all the animal welfare charity recommend more than hour now used hour they also recommend not use routinely when you are work curb behavioural issue like destruction should used only minimally for house training open doored kennel safe den restrain them when injured under veterinary advice assume there ha been research reach these guideline ,0
start walking each through the others space without them there get them more used the smell the other then slow introduction ensure the dog calm and the cat comfortable only few minute time gradually increasing over time never leave them unsupervised until you comfortable ,0
well just because you can get doesn’ mean ’ meeting all nutritional requirement for optimal health other animal experience nutritional imbalance well ,0

what you mean bottom line they’ 3rd party they ship stuff from hill’ kong etc lot food product cannot returned and would think would affect the actual company not chewy even then food company still can’ accept return and often donate the food anyway long wasn’ damaged would assume toy the same way would really unethical they accepted and resold certain product like bed toy ,0

point work with the trainer intimately right now point ask the shelter for advice point find out exactly how much exercise the dog can handle right now how far walk how long should the break right now once the exercise restriction off walk this dog multiple time day could energy burn could mental stimulation agility training some dog nutty when they are sedentary you might think the dog sufficiently exercised enough but the breed need more exercise than you think then you end with hole your wall because they need more exercise mental stimulation this where sometimes breed specific trainer are helpful sometimes not but definitely return point work with the trainer ,0

yes would and think that you should there are way this ethically one designate someone you know take the dog you become incapacitated die case that would sister she know that and ’ all good another get dog from good breeder well established foster based rescue group that guarantee they will take the dog back necessary “rehoming” that way from one good owner place another not devastating for dog many people think for the most part they through period stress and adjustment and then they’ fine dog’ capacity bond generally more powerful than it attachment one specific person sorry for your difficult situation ,0
many dog will start going the door and asking let out their own she not doing that yet and she may start her own you give her time one thing you might start doing asking her she need out before you take her out your regular interval get reaction out her she start building association between the reaction the door and getting outside alternately you want train her use bell something that would just viable take her the door have her ring the bell then take her out she associate that with getting outside the key point starting associate some signal with going out potty ,0
dog will give them family member they help take care him when ’ vacation ,0
aww look your fancy polite boy also impressed already got that much impulse control ,0
shih tzu doe the same thing but other two dog love them ,0
don dog park but have informal play session our local park and when tiny dog come collect enormous dog and leave not that think that dog would intentionally harm small dog just don want see what happens fall him step him also don look back because others don respond the way that and don want see anything bad happens the tiny dog the main thing the safety your dog not etiquette imo ,0
some dog enjoy novelty much human ,0
where mostly medium size herding dog but sometimes get small dog too ’ never been problem have them around most little dog just sniff stuff and watch some the other dog fetch some get into the chasing herding wrestling game that some the dog play think ’ always risk for the little dog owner because you don’ know particular big dog dangerous have problem with small dog being around dog though ,0
usually take dog maybe month old consistently ask get out but you can speed the process little doing potty bell training the bell are pretty inexpensive and there’ video youtube showing how train her use them ,0
this amazing hope they enjoy opening their present ,0
that weird mix but very cool pup ,0
doesn’ “look like cancerous skin lesion ” look like lesion that could have any number cause ,0
shayne from ultimate pet nutrition just wanted let you know that mail away you ever have any question concern you can reach shayne@ultimatepetnutrition com mailto shayne@ultimatepetnutrition com thank you ,0
none know for certain will alive tomorrow comforted the fact that dog breeder will take him back and his dad life not far from his human would facilitate that didn have that would definitely look into finding someone who would take him think everyone should probably have such plan for their pet ,0
wager partly curiosity why they chew and probably slip down fairly easily ,0
have husky that’ about your chow’ size well boston terrier who 15ish pound adult dog ’ not had any issue with that size difference but ’ got exceptionally chill older dog how your chow with smaller dog right now ,0
generally there isn really hard and fast etiquette regarding who should shouldn enter mixed size dog park general think big dog owner know and understand the onus having large dog mixed use facility and will take their dog out they can handle being around small dog but you still have people who lack general courtesy with their dog about the time term what that mean you and your dog think you can only what you been doing \ observe the dog park and see what kind play going before entering \ vigilant when you enter the park and you see any kind distress coming from your dog leave unless dog being outwardly aggressive towards your dog playing too roughly with your dog there really not much more that you can expect term etiquette ,0
’ probably going really hard find reputable breeder that breed this mix but not impossible you still with this kind dog make sure your research the breeder personally own goldendoodle that’ training become service dog ’ wonderful far ’ very food motivated eager please love people other animal ’ active and love work and ’ very smart sometimes too smart however ’ very strong dog and weighs least pound only month old the vet said ’ end being around 100 pound luckily most the mix seems stay smaller but ’ possibility that you could get dog that’ bigger than you planned for ’ also possibility that you could get dog that shed personally dog doesn’ shed but there are dog out there that are the same mix mine that shed very little crazy amount you also may get puppy that doesn’ grow look anything like what you normally see goldendoodle friend that gave our doodle ha goldendoodle her own she’ full grown weighs pound and bit smaller than half the size ours her fur wispy rather than curly and doesn’ look like the same mix all ,0
behalf small dog owner thank you always appreciate when big dog owner the extra mile careful just not worth the risk mingle big dog and small dog dog love the park ’ feel sad denying her that forcing any big dog leave the park demand that there never time which there are only small dog ,0
experience extreme lack courtesy only there aggressive husky our park that see often she uber aggressive our small herding dog and ha made her aggressive and reactive turn when she see that dog the owner refuse acknowledge the aggression their dog have the courtesy the other direction when they see coming she just want play insert eye roll now have avoid them because their dog much bigger and danger doing serious damage our much smaller dog ,0
yeah trying out pea protein wouldn bad idea ,0
this very normal behavior someone new and different they exciting and have checked out all the moreso she know them and doesn get see them very often think this way are you more excited when your friend who visit time week come over you had friend coming from out town the former normal part your week the latter special event and the same for dog really bother you there are breed that are much more likely particularly devoted their person and more standoffish from others ,0
golden husky the left and labraboxer the right jpg ,0
yeah right now trust that big dog owner know their dog and wouldn’ let their dog mixed size park they knew their dog wa aggressive prey driven but that might pretty naive agree that small dog owner are taking bigger risk when entering the dog park try watch dog like hawk whenever enter but accident can happen split second and can impossible prevent even with constant vigilance ,0
have two dog each ha their own crate plus one big bed they can both use the same time smaller one and round one mostly use store their toy planning getting them one more though sometimes they both want the smallish bed curl ,0

there just wanted chime and clear any confusion about nutra thrive shayne from ultimate pet nutrition the way all thing are processed some way another but how and what material are being processed that can cause problem for example kibble processed with high heat that can cause potentially harmful chemical like mallard reaction product and advanced glycation end product which result from the browning protein and carbohydrate during the cooking process nutra thrive us powdered nutrient that have been extracted concentrate certain active constituent and remove water from the raw material prevent growth harmful organism and allow for thing stored room temperature for long period time the drying method used create most these raw material avoid high heat because can damage the integrity the active component mushroom use hot water extraction concentrate the beta glucan molecule optimal nutrition can only achieved through fresh whole food diet for lot people buying store bought kibble and canned food practical and cost efficient option but may lacking some essential vitamin mineral and antioxidant nutra thrive can help fill the missing gap one dog nutrition please mail shayne@ultimatepetnutrition com can assist you with anything else thank you ,0

groomer ’ just got warn you “golden doodles” are one the most difficult breed for pet owner take care coat wise double coat and hair coat were not meant crossed the result can often soft cottony undercoat with wiry guard hair which recipe for near instant matting ’ not going tell you not get one that’ what you want though please please take care find breeder who health test least but please aware that these are some the highest maintenance dog term grooming daily brushing essential just friendly warning you don’ get taken one the breeder who tell you thing like “the coat only need groomed few time year” “they shouldn’ brushed” both ’ heard they are high maintenance make sure you are prepared and like brushing ,0

local dog park ha big small area but sometimes one closed for maintenance mud season get this situation semi regularly the best thing just ask have big dog and always ask small dog owner they are playing with big dog think you see big dog you should ask them they are with little dog before you enter regardless how calm just take second ,0
electronic fence shock collar act deterrent not guarantee but combined with your wooden fence might very well help teach the dog that the fence uncomfortable boundary and not worth standing dig chew worth considering lot depends how motivated the dog the dog want out badly enough the electronic fence isn going stop them ,0

getting another animal only solution you want another animal honestly dog usually never play together when you aren’ home and most dog household don’ notice improvement destructive behaviour that rewarding eating out garbage can off countertop ,0
she really shouldn that upset with you sure you left out but this dog are talking about dog that will apparently eat anything not like you hand fed him nor would have been any safer further away from you ,0
wouldn wrap any organ inside the body other than you already know x200b may cause blockage though ,0
likely because she bored doesn know any better likely combo both ,0
interesting because human toddler are the same way they don get adequate play time and brain train time kong ball will work for couple day but then will bored those you need find way get him adequate exercise before you leave him walk isn going soothe aussie and neither minute fetch advice buy mountain bike find path off road hook him and teach him trot with you rather than run due his age ,0
they didn say they were separating them right now they said that they were going get one the puppy without specifying time ,0
they didn say that they were going adopt the puppy right now the title say thinking adopting one don see any time span there and assume found mean found ,0
which one that had her pro plan sport with salmon but realized further down the list there wa chicken and yeah considered although have pull her from her sport class afford diet like that top monthly dog bill really don want stop class but cost stack and have make budget cut somewhere what did your dermatologist suggest beyond elimination diet and the standard drug atopica prednisone apoquel cytopoint otc med you don mind asking looked chain dermatology clinic our area another option try ,0

dog greets bit more calmly quietly and politely not say his greeting are totally calm quiet polite than doe with other people whether husband our housemate any guest shorty already know this only however because the only one who consistently and sternly enforces greeting behavior that isn crazy le excited see when come home and his favorite person the entire world for sure just have more strict rule would greet everyone else with le over the top enthusiasm they also had and enforced strict rule ,0
been dealing with this issue since pup adoption too and not easy highly recommend you ask your vet about apoquel cytopoint both medication stop the itch receptor your dog feel le itchy pup actually both and hugely improved his quality life they not cheap but much cheaper than allergy test which you can still save for and use this the interim and very much worth imo ,0
this sound like great idea right now our routine mile walk after our class and then some play time the morning then when are home for lunch try give him least half hour training guess just getting used the amount exercise are giving him any recommendation for how get him more active would appreciated ,0
man that awesome how old she and how long did take housetrain her also woke earlier find dog pee and poop her crate good new mean she settling and becoming comfortable the house bad new this might become habit doing her business night when everyone asleep ,0
your situation would consider adopting senior dog and would find somebody take ownership him once gone trusted neighbor friend maybe ,0
ha your vet mentioned prescription allergy medication such apoquel cytopoint not that something you should discussing soon possible thing like bath and ointment are ineffective bandaids you not really addressing the root the problem benadryl and other otc medication rarely work for allergy severe you describing dog ha pollen and flea allergy and his life ha been completely changed his monthly cytopoint shot during pollen season ,0

too bad but good you called you’ just doing food trial personally wouldn’ too worried about feeding grain free diet for couple month and yeah hydrolysed wa expensive but only needed swing for month and then had definite answer that wa worth have older dog and also live place with definitive season and long winter the process might different for you dog issue were also focussed the skin his arm and belly nothing with his ear like your pup but essentially they first did some skin scraping rule out various other possibility then started with strict not single other thing passed his lip wore muzzle off leash make sure didn’ eat thing trail etc hydrolysed diet trial for month rule out food after that were offered blood skin testing narrow down environmental allergy went that route the plan wa use that info formulate allergy shot slowly desensitize his immune system the allergen iirc that take about year and not effective for all dog given dog wa already the time and only affected during the summer month opted against this instead ’ been cytopoint shot since apoquel wa also option only get them when his itching get bad and our local vet wa able teach administer myself our only cost the drug itself pricy yes but significantly le than the ongoing infection antibiotic antihistamine vet visit lack sleep for all that wa happening beforehand and know you’ concerned about the lack long term study were too but ultimately taking the chance giving dog slightly shorter comfortable life wa better than having him stay misery for longer life also one thing were told that food allergy typically are caused sensitization protein over time that’ why weird protein can work there’ nothing inherently more allergenic about chicken beef ’ just much more likely adult dog ha had more it life your dog still puppy ’ say ’ much le likely ’ food allergy though that’ just opinion ’ not vet and you’ looking for limited ingredient ’ look for something you’ puppy ha never once had including all treat table food etc sorry this novel but know this can hard figure out first ’ happy share ,0

think you right ,0
just lost best friend two month ago and wa absolutely heartbreaking and soul shaking but she lived happy life with lot love and treat miss her much the pain never go away but neither the amazing memory keep your head ,0
just habit there nothing complicated here dog are very habit driven animal she associate you with particular state mind when you absent she calm and when you show that crazy state mind manifest itself plus she would have been extremely excited about seeing you that would have turned another notch you need habituate her your presence around other dog and change that stupid habit when you take her the daycare just sit and watch her neutrally for minute with neutral expression your face don talk her give her any attention then just leave when you come pick her sit and watch for little while the same bland neutral manner let the daycare lady handle her without getting involved calm and bland possible this should integrate you into her experience the daycare and she stop associating you with that crazy unbalanced state mind ,0
although have large ish dog believe that dog all size have equal right play the park strongly agree with what you said about observing the owner first see they actively engaging with their dog playing with their phone experience that better indication potential issue than different dog size ,0
all you can love her and make sure she not pain her body may give her but her spirit will live nothing can break the bond you both have you will keep her your heart little boy passed last year ,0
try change the default hangout place somewhere else that’ not “dog” advice but think ’ the best move ,0
been known visit ,0
there not much you can about this you right feel afraid this dangerous situation and that dog bite risk shit outright telling everyone bite risk every time bark and growl her boyfriend trash and sound like she ignorant and out her depth stay far away from this woman house ,0
yeah this what think too ’ not about the breed think these sign should paid attention with any dog almost think because ’ pit and she’ this whole discrimination thing that lead her ignoring his behavior like she had lab who wa barking and growling people would she acknowledge the problem more easily and just apologize and kennel him and work ,0
that just what puppy everything toy ,0
going come down whether you willing address head ignore let the friendship pit owner can very defensive even when the issue isn discrimination against pit ,0
heart with you may you gather comfort from the wonderful love and life you gave her ,0
dog park with rule and designated area are not thing country just have large grassy meadow which dog run around off leash kick ball and barbeque and the dog run around with the kid and mostly all good the hood always think ironic that american are constantly going about freedom but seem have more rule and regulation than anywhere else ,0
your friend reacts badly legitimate well worded concern then that suck ,0
senior dog ha started doing this after year with you started when her food wa changed she been the vet she happy and surprisingly healthy for her age concern there only dog household and all honesty she just super chill mellow dog pick her food bowl when another dog come over just avoid any potential squabble though honestly don think she mind she doesn care about them drinking out her water bowl but also case visiting dog might react badly eating something stomach isn used when take her her dog sitter who ha multiple dog she adjusts having her bowl picked when food left ,0
think the whole environment the home and the way people there treat each other and the dog would enough make uncomfortable being there the dog being scary dangerous just the icing this chaotic cake you can honest enough tell her that her dog scare you you don have apologize for shamed out your fear you have right feel what you feel ,0
guarantee she will react badly address she might actually start putting the dog away but she’ total hole from here out that’ just how she operates she’ the right thing but hold grudge ,0
stevie adorable sorry she’ sick ,0
then that not good friend and you better off just telling her not worth your sanity this point sound like wasn big deal you wouldn coming here ask for advice ,0
imo only selfish you don arrange 100 foolproof life plan for the event your death sorry hear about your condition hope the diagnosis negative ,0
dad’ dog exhibited concerning behavior and last week attacked and murdered mom’ dog ’ not about her being bully breed ’ about her being capable lot damage while also exhibiting aggressive behavior ’ impossible not for feeling hurt with something like this you over there research what the case dog attack took over five minute for her let mom’ yorkie poo ,0
hill and royal canin are usually recommended because they usually sponsor the one class that vet take for nutrition and they are really good marketing vet and offer them free product etc most the quality food company have vet and other expert staff that doesn necessarily mean they are good any mean you even look the ingredient panel you can see how horrible most those food are royal canin usually ha corn one meat byproduct without any meat meat meal mostly corn there vet really think corn should the main food for dog they are crazy there are plenty hypoallergenic food that aren made them and much much better almost all hill and royal canin contain chicken and grain the two most common allergen would never ever recommend either food for dog with allergy study also show allergy are more common low quality protein the two company described have mostly byproduct have you read what byproduct consists definitely not quality protein plant ingredient simply should not the main ingredient your dog food their bio availability dog significantly lower and high carb diet are not good idea for dog will lead diabetes yeast infection and all kind digestive problem not adverse grain food for dog without allergy but believe quality grain moderation recent concern about the potential maybe higher level heart disease nothing when compared the con corn and beak diet dog just aren built for that they need meat and organ ,0
yeah agree she’ never been favorite person but have mutual friend who think are good people and that’ why ’ stick around witnessing how they treat the dog ha highlighted thing about them that don’ like think you’ right that not wanting around may have just much with feeling about the human doe fear the dog none other friend treat dog ownership this way and would all put their dog away even subtly implied wasn’ comfortable ,0
’ sorry for your mom and her dog actually have researched what quite bit and confident that couldn’ much all the dog weighs almost much and don’ know she even ha break stick ,0

with all due respect all you doing here spewing regurgitated bit folk belief spewed facebook reddit etc and bunch misinformation you can just say study also show allergy are more common low quality protein without citation link credible and know you can provide one because that meaningless stupid statement gave you link source all which were credible please the same ,0
like add that not trying down vet all they have much learn and since those company pay for the one nutrition class lot time that all they really learn about that they have much other very important thing learn don usually advocate doing anything other than your vet suggests and your dog ha crystal kidney problem recommend doing whatever your vet suggests however for the average dog those food are just bad for dog with allergy only lid food that doesn utilize high quantity grain poor quality chicken acceptable ,0
thank you for sharing she look like sweet pupper ,0
here link corn look for the protein quality one not just spewing crap learned working under zoologist specializing canine nutrition and book borrowed from the main one but try find the study ,0
dog will eliminate it crate the crate large enough for get away from it defecation need just big enough for the dog turn around depending the age the dog would take out every three four hour least long enough pee and minute after eating dog shouldn have poop more than time day but you need take out more often the beginning schedule underfeeding better than overfeeding mainstream brand from big company like purina are usually the most digestible and reliable for firm stool after the dog house trained you can change the diet when you are the house with the dog keep attached you with leash ha where you you can keep attached you tether someplace where you can see the most important thing keeping schedule got our dog month and she four now but still walk her four time day try not keep her crated too long time again the crate little large you can expect her eliminate ,0

’ sorry she sound wonderful the two you were lucky have each other ,0
ugh ’ sorry she look like she the sweetest little snugglebug and like she love her home and her family you have loved her well ,0
like add that not trying down vet all they have much learn and since those company pay for the one nutrition class lot time that all they really learn about that they have much other very important thing learn honestly that level misplaced condescension could only come from someone who ha idea how advanced postgraduate education and credentialing for that field maybe any field work your vet not ignorant brainwashed idiot with much learn from random people such you with your vague yet vehement opinion about how some food just bad for dog with allergy only lid food that doesn utilize high quantity grain poor quality chicken acceptable for dog with allergy only lid food that doesn utilize high quantity grain poor quality chicken acceptable wtf that even supposed mean food allergy are properly diagnosed via elimination diet once you identified allergen you avoid the fucking allergen ,0
dog shed tuft fur just before summer and winter look pretty normal just keep watching for excessive itching and bare patch give him good brush and see you can get all out ,0
’mon stevie pull through get better ,0
they have nice chart this article which show what percentage dog have reaction when exposed certain thing beef and dairy lead over chicken and wheat but since most commercial food use chicken and wheat that going the issue more they talk about how mostly going something the dog exposed lot food allergy why chicken and soy are such common allergen are they hill food for allergy been told hydrolyzed protein don always help with the allergen and may cause other ill health effect but have try find the article some the stuff she would talk about may have been from obscure study but ask her and look more today and tomorrow x200b either way can think why company would ever use corn their main ingredient for any formula with high glycemic index nor why one wouldn put meat meal food but rather byproduct which can mostly beak feces and feather you can possibly saying corn byproduct and vitamin are better meal than meat organ sweet potato and oatmeal ,0
completely agree sure you have lot love give and think rather selfish some the others who say wrong you are going through enough right now think you don deserve this ,0

yeah think let her get feel for first maybe she get bored with the other dog after walking around for minute opposite she get amped can even the trick title and another question allowed just walk around with dog there bringing crate for the car and obviously not doing for doggie social hour but not sure should drag her crate inside too waiting the arena there line for trick title cgc ,0
sooo cute ,0
have two mutt with schnauz somewhere the genealogy love them both much death what great dog ,0
course double check with your vet but per several vet ’ worked with the animal fat are fine ’ the protein that cat and dog can have allergy cat severely allergic chicken and she’ dead chicken fat triggered her allergy ,0
’ sorry sound like you gave your girl great life that she wouldn’ have had otherwise ’ always taken comfort that dog isn’ suffering anymore but doesn’ make the loss hurt any le stevie look lot like lola she’ rescue and she’ ten now much loved her young dog the old chihuahua are the best give her some good cuddle this weekend ,0
aggression ha large genetic component and while not guarantee that this pup will become aggressive there very strong chance that she will become aggressive true aggression damn near impossible train out people who successfully own aggressive dog usually end utilizing variety management strategy ensure that the dog never put position where they are likely lash out and even then not unheard for the owner have make the decision euthanize their dog because the dog just too dangerous and unpredictable even the owner furthermore unless talking about one very small number breed scenario where aggressive dog desired responsible breeder not breed aggressive dog meaning there better than average chance that this dog will end with physical health issue well yeah steer clear this litter ,0
agreed ,0
this technically count boutique diet you may not comfortable with but ’ look into primal freeze dried food single protein several different type the protein organ muscle bone etc and non animal protein based what little know about boutique food causing health issue feel relatively comfortable that freeze dried food that are formulated meet aafco standard are choice the alternate source protein legume potato etc seem the biggest problem with boutique diet ,0
allowed just walk around with dog there yes just remember considerate about people that are the ring can’ remember crating wa nearby not might set differently this year anyway you can take zuzia with you and scope out see you want need bring crate there’ not check for trick dog but when trial usually leave the dog the car while check and decide where want crate etc ,0
would say that doesn’ seem like enough time have dog have you considered another kind pet ,0
definitely wouldn trust other owner have good idea their dog the number people with aggressive dog who think they are friendly pretty high people love their dog and aren always realistic about what they might ,0
for bit more clarity interested canadian eskimo dog and they have history having tough attitude ,0
finding dog walker will difficult wa hoping that walking the dog before work and after work would enough how are you going address potty break combat boredom loneliness you may somewhat with pretty senior dog that doesn mind much ,0
thanks for the honest feedback don’ want harm dog leaving lonely ,0
interested canadian eskimo dog and their number are bit low too low for very picky with the pup ,0
hey have some experience could give you work and have many after work and weekend activity have two dog that are life adopted them when they were 3ish year old past the puppy stage they’ small and love sleeping not active spend every minute able with them and take them anywhere can that allows dog work home when possible work great room mate chef she work hour day crazy hour she got lab puppy randomly not doable she should not have puppy with her schedule older le active dog would have been much more realistic and suitable for her lifestyle raising the puppy and not have enough time give this puppy basically yes you can have dog but think about your lifestyle and budget realistically people say they wa golden retriever labradoodle puppy but don’ realize how high maintenance puppy lab other popular large breed can more mature independent easy going dog may great match for you ,0
very fair point don’ have good answer that probably speaks for itself ,0
whoever let you purchase livestock guardian breed without thoroughly researching what the dog living situation and expected training not responsible breeder these dog are some the most difficult train and some the hardest fix once they have developed bad habit please breed specific research and know what rule the puppy need follow from day one can live structured and healthy life others here have given great advice ,0
there such thing dog training for new dog owner would good for trained these thing ,0
from cursory research having gsd mix unknown breeding this might devastating the breed whole because would eliminate large fraction the high quality dog that would otherwise contribute desirable quality the breed anyone who know more than would like correct please would look what dog the breeder pairing together see whether breeding carrier really red flag ,0
you have her amazing life and amazing memory and she gave the same you and absolutely nothing can take that away from either you you clearly have much love for being pet don’ let death squander that beautiful compassion when one dog passed know channeling all love for the one lost into the one still had helped lot ,0
dog are highly social creature and therefore have social companionship need leaving the dog alone for essentially alone except for few hour the weekend not considered humane treatment twelve hour routine basis also too long for dog hold his bladder bowel experiment you try hold that schedule why not volunteer shelter the weekend you could get better idea what like live with dog and some experience with them they would grateful for your attention ,0
honestly don’ think would right fair leave the dog hour every day waiting use the bathroom have small breed dog and she need every hour during the day also the dog would get bored and sad left for that long every day dog are social and need attention have you thought about another lower maintenance pet creature that would better fit with your lifestyle ,0
this sweet ,0
you bet they have puppy and dog training class all over the place which are training for caretaker and dog alike ,0
she’ amazing ,0

depends who the carrier bred ideally you want breed away from the gene but ha only recently become available test ’ not reasonable for every carrier cut out breeding line carrier still can tremendous asset breeding program bred clear take time once gene ha been identified clear entirely from gene pool without decimating the breed all that known far that dog that homozygous positive for considered ‘ risk’ they might develop they might not this where pedigree research the last pedigree important also this one test many that should done through away carrier with excellent longevity behind them great hip elbow heart and temperament when they can contribute the bred being bred clear just watch the breeding this breeder doing and ask for the history behind the dog question you want know age and cause death including cropped this just important the gene itself not yet know why some homozygous positive develop and some don’ ,0
honestly don like telling people they can have dog they work full time because that our situation however the people know that work full time and have dog devote the rest their free time their dog and hire dog walker take their dog daycare you could least hire dog walker that make little better between and husband there are some day were hard get much time with our dog want have low energy breed but even our dog need more than walk day she get crazy night got our dog puppy and barely got any sleep and that with taking time off work most the time just took quick nap the couch the floor with our puppy wa like being zombie are you prepared have your thing your home destroyed bored dog that happens lot and often why dog are given ,0
are these dog aggressive reactive aggression usually mean the dog seek out hurt reactivity usually response the environment that can counter conditioned for example dog might bark and lunge aggressively dog across the street usually this fear based response get you before you get sort thing usually you can counter condition this response using something like classical conditioning reprogram the dog brain from scary bad thing that must scare off something like oooo that thing again good thing happen when see that thing however this type reconditioning can take lot time and work especially you working against some really strong instinct not necessarily advocating for going through with but certainly possible train dog and use management technique work with the dog whatever yiu decide stay away from using force against aggressive reactive dog though usually this only make them worse ,0
rescued purebred dog from responsible breeder ,0
pretty big issue breed pembroke with estimated dog testing abnormal carrier risk would pretty devastating use status the only quantifier for breeding only ish clear gsds according ofa are ranked abnormal result with the breed affected would ask the breeder their thought before completely ruling out the breeder also know really really suck but painless and end life disease ’ not the worst diagnosis the world ‍♀️ ,0
mine only ha one dedicated bed the bedroom apartment only like 600 not that big would let her lay bed but don’ want her tracking thing any creepy thing bed let her get the couch the living room she get sleep there the day ,0
don have one but lot people who own ceds tend comment that they are quite aggressive and even ckc recommends the dog companion for only adult owner hate saying this but don think they are the level pit bull their aggression may just reactive ,0
good question not really just hopeful that the pup can grow well mannered ,0
alright thanks for the help maybe think progress slow because never actually housebroken dog before our previous dog had bathroom spot the house decided actually try and housebreak our current one don have the pee smell the house ,0
thank you for sharing and sorry for your loss doe make you feel bit cold hearted similar situation both parent willing whatever take and yet also relying make the final decision because they can’ wa the one who had look the vet and make double sure euthanasia wasn’ better option while seeing father choking out the corner eye but our responsibility and part giving your pet the best life you can ’ sat through euthanasia several time also work with animal and never get easier but good knowing you did everything you could without also letting their last bit life get point it unenjoyable before making that decision dog and animal general teach love trust forgiveness and courage like other will through this time and time again ’ all worth ,0
dog don’ mature the sense that human being well mannered come with lot consistent training ,0
would not get dog with aggressive parent ever it not unheard for entire litter euthanized adult because they were all aggressive aggression pretty genetic mom and dad are both aggressive ’ say ’ pretty likely the pup will too don’ want manage people coming and going from house potentially delaying child because dog aggression having high alert all the time case ‘slip ’ but maybe the risk are worth you can you manage human aggressive dog for the next year ,0
checkout reactivity see the kind behavior people are working with various breed various reason for their reactivity and you can look into classical conditioning bat training lat engage disengage for understanding the type work this entail and what you against ,0
you don’ have time for dog 13h day every day not including social life getting grocery sleeping not enough time for dog ,0
don buy from breeder with aggressive dog all you doing supporting their practice and encouraging them continue producing puppy with high chance aggression which only worsens the breed whole you can train puppy become well mannered dog but the genetics for aggression will still there and will passed down any puppy might produce the only way improve the breed support reputable breeder who are breeding dog with stable temperament and lack aggression the line you rescuing then say you need consider whether you the right circumstance bring potentially aggressive dog into your home you have enough money and time cover extensive training class and possibly behaviorist thing take turn for the worse the puppy may turn out fine but start showing aggressive behavior will you all right with never having another pet possibly child during it lifetime great you want rescue puppy and give future but there also absolutely shame admitting that you may not able handle the risk and need with safer bet ,0
way how housetrain dog any age redir mobile desktop encoding utf8ref db 1891767089 ,0
and should add why you want this breed because it look don pick breed because the way they look pick one because how can will fit into your lifestyle you might find another breed out there that catch your fancy but also ha more appropriate temperament for what you want with the dog ,0
doe the dog have any known behavioural issue long you are with managing dog who dog aggressive very common issue bully breed should fine this mean dog park and being careful being dog heavy area lab are universally great for first time owner and pit bull although also needing regular hearty outdoor exercise are often wonderful companion solo dog owning person ,0

think you already being more conscientious than most dog owner small and big dog alike pretty comfortable with our dog playing with smaller one since she gentle the dog park frequent doesn have lot small dog though the small dog that come and spend long time there tend better trained other small dog just pas while barking the dog park dog lol once while small dog owner will come and will get scared pick their dog and leave one time lady got mad this teenager and her dad because their aussie puppy wa nipping her french bulldog ,0
would say absolutely with few caveat you should financially stable enough position that the cost owning dog won put you risk bankruptcy and sure ask the shelter whether the dog ha shown any sign aggression separation anxiety since those are the two behavioral issue think take the most amount difficulty and experience handle not then say for that lot more experience than lot first time dog owner have ,0
would for sure just try hang out elsewhere sound like this dog just ha outlet and doesn know proper way act barking and growling aren bad thing the fact think need pretty bad though honestly the biggest problem are the lack exercise and even more the shitty as boyfriend she doesn kick him out there probably nothing that can done improve the situation time move ,0
you changed her life and gave her happiness her life when clearly her life didn start out great she clearly love you and you are her person hoping you get more time with her ,0
thanks sure seems like lot ifs love the breed and adore the history they have and they are canadian symbol may skip maybe try luck with pup ,0

take our dog food away she hasn eaten minute she used eat ton puppy and then all sudden got really picky around month old taking her food away worked lot better than trying find different food topper think that just made her more picky our vet advised that some dog just start levelling off and don require much food before our dog eats regularly now and will sometimes skip meal but our vet said that totally normal and should just check her body condition once while worried agree with buddog1 though that not having set feeding time really mess their toilet schedule ,0
most local rescue group not receive government funding many private donation shelter that’ why they often have higher adoption fee opinion you shouldn’ discount kill shelter these are government run facility that are doing their best take dog that have other option essentially keeping them off the street your research and find the dog that right for you and from there looked lot different local rescue group when wa looking for dog local shelter just happen have the right dog for had money set aside and budget what wa willing spend adopt dog but just happen free definitely shared your concern about scam that why chose adopt from shelter instead from rehoming website check see the rescue have their own website you might also able find review through google while many rescue work exclusively through foster program some may have their own facility good luck ,0
everything sound great just warned that not every dog fully over being shut down from the shelter after week foster the dog might still not showing ’ true self but week the foster mom will have really good idea the dog starting show some issue ,0
dog park are opinion generally bad idea practice you don’ know what dog are there they’ trained they’ aggressive most vet know and behaviorist warn strongly against them vet said all the worst dog fight damage ’ operated ha been due dog park honestly step one dog park find small play group with regular who you can get know instead step two don’ use shock collar they’ absolutely abhorrent training method ’ basically learned helplessness read the concept and can actually cause severe behavioral issue ’ quite possible because you shock your dog when near others dog associate shock now with other dog being near and getting aggressive try drive them away try avoid being shocked ’ unfortunately within the realm possibility that you caused this behavioral change step three certified dog behaviorist who doesn’ use punishment for training positive reinforcement power choice only thing avoid trainer for they use shock collar they use choke collar they use pronged collar they use punishment they refer cesar milan good trainer thing look for good trainer one who avoids all those thing mentioned before that bad trainer use good dog trainer would cite someone like karen pryor instead cesar milan source have degree psychology which the basis for good animal training and amateur animal trainer hobby work with many professional animal trainer well versed the field ’ spent hour training under these people and reading the topic ,0

and little “stevie” are wishing you and your stevie all the time the world thank you for your post ,0
gotcha well here one last thing read about nature nurture ,0
there are two problem with invisible fence shock collar for boundary first doesn stop other dog critter getting another dog decides come and cause trouble your dog are huge disadvantage being got another dog and being shocked the collar when they try defend themselves secondly the dog get out despite the shock because really really motivated small critter get and then run out through hole the fence dog are likely give chase can get back and may run further away continues get shocked when try come back other thought possible solution the pit neutered not that could help with this issue enormously there stuff keep them entertained out the yard somewhere dig digging pit with chew wrapped piece old towel great scatter feed frozen block stock treat and spot keep warm cool and out the element are the dog getting enough exercise and mental stimulation 2x30 minute walk and some training time and food the form enrichment rather than out bowl and couple good game fetch tug etc each day your dog spend lot time out there could you bring them inside more ,0
the dog collar probably escalated the problem ha now formed negative association with the dog park there evidence that show that shock collar can often escalate fight well ,0
exactly piggybacking off this comment kill shelter can some the most human shelter because they will euthanize dog that are behaviourally unwell and suffering kill shelter sound good but keeping dog cage for 22h day for year when you know can never adopted out mind much crueler ,0
just set play date and ask trainer vet the area they run play session for small dog many ,0
the world need more bat breed ,0
course college out state currently but still live home when the semester over and parent are also agreement with adopting dog they prefer the dog stay home but dad ha also done lot volunteering with know how handle dog well they are helping with some payment but want able pay for most her need like her food vet visit and other necessity think the only thing need their help with financially would there wa emergency that required expensive surgery but again sell all possession pay for myself that happened already have some money put away just case work during the summer and saved lot money over the year also have been contact with the foster mom who going connect the person charge the adoption process she told this dog ha had behavioural issue when she wa under her care she perfect with other dog isn leash reactive aggressive over resource and doesn have separation anxiety ,0

foam sound promising ’ look for thanks for the tip ,0
have heard that been doing research the shut down period and saw something called the rule which pretty much said that some dog won settle down until least three month totally okay with that and pretty patient she want take her time getting comfortable home she doe show issue though rather try work once see those issue arise over having give her back would hate give dog easily like that ,0
now appropriate time you need ask yourself what quality life doe the dog have right now because honestly not eating lethargic and not drinking water raise red flag everywhere for and that your dog the end it life for your mum you can try find another vet explain her that the dog death will not peaceful kind her dog all she will essence starve death whether this take day week you wont know but it cruel just let the dog fade away ,0
your doggy going make ,0
have you looked any local shelter near you one you can drive perhaps there may plenty good dog close you that won need relocated require many fee front plus you have chance meet the dog beforehand and see going the right fit sound like you only looking adoption website and dog that are far away from you they require relocation guessing they need transported considerable distance hence the fee there reason for that ,0

cesar favorite just kidding watch his show because they are interesting and you can always take tip what not and some thing you can obviously isn well liked this board but there are situation which his advice helpful including remaining calm and recognizing the sign your dog diffuse situation topic recommendation were related what knew course they aren the end all all but the type person study much material from many different source possible and then consolidate that information into meaningful course action believe the dog baseline fight flight reflex threshold likely very low not sure how that get built but through time and effort involving combination tactic ,0

your dog’ behaviour will let you know you are you are not many the dog who exhibit problem behaviour are just mismatch their owner owner lifestyle ’ not anxious and upset when you’ not around chewing your house barking non stop ’ eating and playful and healthy and his behaviour isn’ “bad” and doesn’ suggest ’ unhappy then you can safely assume ’ happy ,0

stopped reading after “healthy” ugh ,0
you described effectively every public restroom ever encountered except replace dog pee with human pee but yeah those room are fucking foul ,0
reading through this and your original post you chalked yourself you not value dog’ life more than human’ dog owner aren’ crazy lizard people still value human life often time are situation where have figure out what best the quality our own life verse continuing care for dog still care about the quality our life our child our friend and our family but value dog’ life acknowledge that dog living being with ’ own heartbeat and with it own thought dog don’ make mistake spite you just three year old doesn’ make mistake spite you they are simply incapable caring for themselves yes human grow much more smart and independent but dog and people are two different specie the end the day dog are companion child are your own genetic offspring you choose have both and both are commitment but yes human life tends mean more than dog’ life however noted the original person who you were responding don’ get dog your mind might change might not and you will misery ’ also not quite sure how you would with child since you have noted that your stance are immovable ’ tell you right now that child don’ give shit what your stance are discipline only go far you have respect the autonomy other living creature including human least you value the life child imagine you would more forgiving you don’ want dog and don’ see the value dog don’ get dog how you and your decide work this disagreement out between you and her ,0
peroxide and alcohol are some the worst thing treat wound with since both damage the tissue and slow the healing process peroxide doesn dry the wound keep moist and kill living tissue regular water would better than either sure you won die from using them but stubborn stupidity the face better science and knowledge continue ,0
that depends the organization the shelter volunteer with technically requires people return the dog least get approval before rehoming but transfer the chip fully into the adopter name really have way being alerted someone did rehome the dog and the language mostly just there bit safety net case have someone come try adopt dog for banned person something like that which ha happened before ,0
objectively value dog presence le than human and have been pretty quick severe relationship with immediate family and friend after they significantly violated boundary similar vein can see why would put with dog that would make unhappy don get dog seriously don you going quick get rid the dog doesn fit exactly within rigid pre conceived construct then just don get dog you just sending shelter sooner later ,0
how would with ramp maybe you could fashion something that sits over the step could walk gradual incline instead the steep step ,0

don think there real conflict between boundary part the family family and have boundary and are close precisely because respect each other communicate well and know what annoys doesn annoy people you gonna share space with someone even that someone dog you have have boundary rule routine avoid going insane least imho but also these thing are negotiated between everyone that space which with dog doe include that dog you can have expectation and work meet those but you never have absolute control ,0

the dog park often better than doggy sibling for dog playing with new different dog all the time really exciting mentally and physically stimulating playing with the same dog all the time becomes routine and not stimulating you’ also read lot post here about people who have gotten and second dog and the first dog hate also doggy friend not the same you you are your dog’ primary relationship and getting another dog doe not change that objective way dog may happier with family with kid and other pet but your dog definitely happier with you sound like you are providing for your pup just fine guilt about the quality care come with how much you love them ,0

shibas are great dog but don’ think shiba going any “easier” train than gsd other than being physically easier control due their size shibas are not low energy and they have high prey drive they’ also prone dog aggression they’ actually pretty loud and have scream that’ piercing really annoying hear apartment building there’ shiba that scream the building across from ours whenever dog walk and you can hear through the closed window ’ the 3rd floor ,0

kept puppy crate during the day until she got older would home lunch everyday feed her and let her out there the option paying someone feed you dog and let them out but that get expensive older dog are fine alone for hour but puppy cannot alone this long ,0
congrats ,0
not asking for anything ,0
hired dog walker come for potty break year ago this cost 300 month not insignificant expense boy wa crate trained began experimenting with leaving him out half day dog walker wa instructed leave him out when she left for the day when wa month old daycare only option you have very good daycare with well trained staff and specific puppy program otherwise advisable wait until the puppy least month old before entering the regular daycare setting bad experience can have life long impact your puppy behavior ,0
yayyyy congrats ,0
both your dog are gorgeous and lucky have you their life ’ sure ’ fill out really quickly gsd malamute mix wa underweight when rescued her but she soon bulked she still the slender side for gsd mix but she’ adorable and very strong 41kg ,0
let start saying obsessed with dog love him bit buy him more toy than had kid but boundary are for both our benefit like raising kid everyone doe different and ha thing they let slide and what they don and sometimes you need bribe the kid get agreement but the end the day you not letting them bratty for their benefit the future also you probably really insulted your you didn mention least some thing her family did with the dog that you like and would the same example roommate dog bark lot knew would driven insane that looked for le barky breed now roommate dog barky dog not only can drive ppl insane they live close get many side look and ppl crossing the road even though good boy the dog ha anxiety and being worked but process mine bark when someone knock the door and training him not cause that doesn fly for and would loose mind there wa nonstop barking also would never tolerate dog not being house trained and not doing anything about though for food begging long mine isn people face lay down the floor and will stare you while you eat fine with that but soon stand and go towards eating putting him back down because will not fight the dog for food ,0
didn get the feeling from post that they thought this wa peer reviewed information all rather seems like they want get idea their potential future client perception nutrition raw feeding based pop culture netflix think that great thing for vet training explore given that they undoubtedly encounter some client that come with some preconceived notion about the pet food industry and they should prepared handle those interaction gracefully ,0
hmm wa saying the dog probably doe know but how interesting that would detected before the human case pregnancy detection they seem think smell but there quite bit that some dog can detect that simply can interesting think about like seizure detection dog they aren totally certain how the dog can predict those believed either very slight facial change that only dog seem able notice perhaps some sort electric field change the brain hopefully someday they some more study try and pinpoint exactly what going also seen some admittedly light study that suggest some dog can tell when their owner going return home even without set schedule but not sure how reliable the study are ,0
how your dog ,0
this may not popular recommendation but suggest you wait until your youngest least year old dog even those who get along with child are often overwhelmed very young baby toddler they are scary dog they are impulsive grabby unsteady their foot jerky crawling along temptation dropping food and therefore temptation guard essentially you need supervise the child dog interaction with 100 focused attention for long time sort suck the romance out the fairytale kid and dog living harmony together head over stopthe77 com watch their video not that you can have dog with kid just that doing well and safely enormous amount work attention ,0
everyone and every dog different personally always came home during lunch maybe look into dog walker excerise the dog during the day really research about dog daycare heard lot bad and good thing about but before enroll dog might try taking the dog park somewhere with lot dog see they like are comfortable being around lot dog some dog just dont like being around bunch dog it too much start off crating play pin cage laundry room for the dog til they potty trained can slowly see the dog okay being left roam themselves the house try leaving min and work your way when first rescued dog she started off crate never left her more than couple hour left toy and treat water attachment thing cage too but slowly left the cage door open let her roam and now know shell just play lay her bed couch and sleep til get back also would recommend waiting til you have long weekend holiday break vaction get dog they have time bond with you get used their new surroundings and you have time work some basic training now basically just walk dog good min before leave make sure she potty change her water bowl her toy are accessible thats her get she want play but ill pull few out leave treat and bone for her maybe leave food depending feeding time also leave the music leave light depending the situation and how long going gone ,0
ahh congratulation ,0
have ptsd and rowan natural helping cope with having flashback panic attack she immediately jump and lap and lick face and she always happy cuddle when feeling down even the necessary routine ,0
his resource guarding only manifest the dog park wouldn really worry about you can look general resource guarding training and make game home you guy play and maybe even take the road while walk and such try and alleviate any anxiety may have about thing view high value would not board him doggy day care moving forward though would not trust your average day care worker able provide your dog with safe environment free resource find valuable this almost definitely part him becoming mature adult tolerance for certain antic and behavior fall away and dog park become le safe some dog mature with that age could feeling that the chaos the dog park making him anxious and feel like need defensive about certain thing there like bowl ball good hear you are not going bringing him back the park the future you know any the owner the dog like play with you can consider setting play date where still get socialize but also get more controlled environment ,0
sound like they reviewing get perspective not fact piece ,0

taking the chance the dog finding new home being as raped think you need call authority asap please ,0
yes they have cancer detection dog and they are mostly trained but the training probably doesn cause them able detect cancer but rather how alert the human people with cancer they think based smell and course can smell cancer can really teach them smell cancer only train them tell they can smell and when they smell like cadaver dog many dog can smell the chemical released from decomp but take training teach them tell about guess that fair number dog are physically capable smelling cancer and some percentage have fair idea that mean sick and some percentage just see unusual smell some might act different when encountering this smell especially they have figured out mean sickness idea what the percentage would though ,0
especially you get puppy depends the age you get the puppy but always recommend that new owner puppy take minimum week off work stay home with the puppy and get him her settled took three week and wa really happy with that choice during that time you want get started potty training crate training and helping them learn confident when alone this isn exact science but handy starting point generally speaking puppy can hold their bladder \ hour per month age when resting state during the day napping their crate generally people bring puppy home \ week age you should plan for your puppy need pee break every \ hour for the first month this mean arranging come home from work multiple time throughout the day paying for daycare dog walker eventually you can reduce that single break throughout the day and then when your puppy old enough staying work for the full hour for some people old enough mean month personally have puppy who nearing adulthood almost year and still choose come home lunch just because can and enjoy mod puppy101 and always recommend that puppy are crate trained possible dog are naturally averse eliminating where they sleep make the potty training process much easier you won have your puppy wandering around peeing the floor while you away backsliding potty training progress crating also keep your puppy and your belonging safe generally people start trust their puppy free roam when home alone somewhere between year age you also need consider your priority outside work hour you gone for hour day you need make sure that you giving your dog the stimulation and exercise she need outside those hour that can mean getting early for game fetch every morning making sure you home right after work for walk going weekend adventure that really tire your pup out into the work week you like out lot after work sleep generally chill out and turn off your brain the evening dog might not ideal for you especially young puppy they put your entire life hold for few month and require constant supervision when awake ,0

training shiba going very different than training gsd and may frustrating going from working breed highly independent breed with little desire please they aren really low energy dog though being apartment doesn mean you can have high energy dog dog rarely self exercise sufficiently yard their own anyway while shibas are generally not big barker and are often quiet they also what called the shiba scream when highly aroused recommend searching youtube for example shibas tend very prey driven and while they are described cat like wouldn assume they would necessarily get along with cat they really cool little dog have three our barn barn hunt class and they blast watch but are huge change from gsd ,0
why not lot dog looooove rain dog could splash puddle all day would honestly more mean not let him play the rain all day ,0
read above comment posted before hers talk about the three most common change dog when there pregnant woman owner about one three physical closeness especially the form lying the stomach mother wanting rest their head the pregnant mother stomach quite common some dog will even insist trying lie near the stomach anyone pregnant that around pack not you being rather rude too are all sharing anecdote and one insinuating dog have magical power but many dog can absolutely detect pregnancy probably from the change woman smell dog can smell million time better than can might seem like magic you but them perfectly normal make sense biologically well dog wolf are very pack oriented and very exciting time for the pack when the head female pregnant would only make sense that member the pack might instinctively want keep her torso warm and protected dog wolf are very aware vulnerable area ,0

sound like the dog ha seperation anxiety quite badly ,0
that’ delicate terrain know how people get the whole blinder thing relationship you obviously know your friend better but maybe something the effect “hey friend ’ seen some kind disturbing behaviour from your towards your dog and ’ not really okay with have you seen behaviour too ’ worried about your dog’ wellbeing maybe chat with your about ” ’ tough for sure but ’ say something before going animal control that could damage your relationship with your friend doe this crazy chick treat your friend poorly ,0

the dog new the home crate may more appropriate than whole room training the crate happy place and crate training general there are way train dog more comfortable it own exercising the dog before leaving may help also playing music talk radio etc you have any sense where the other dog different room that may contributing ,0
idea where the other dog unfortunately ,0
sorry for your loss answer your question german shepherd and shibas are quite different term personality add what chowbacca604 already stated shibas are typically extremely stubborn and harder train due their low biddability which highly different from gsd for example you may find your shiba resisting home after walk being extremely insistent going his her direction and refusing any other direction think ’ quite possible get shiba but note that will probably different experience than gsd and won’ easier any mean for example you won’ shouldn’ let shiba off leash due unreliable recall dog park turn out aggressive and have work consistent training motivate your shiba each breed ha their own pro and con ,0
you the only one far get the reference ,0
don’ want them facing any legal charge sorry you enabling them for animal abuse and being complicit they get arrested well good ,0
yeah when first came across that subreddit seemed pretty well the concept seemed stupid because most response pretty much have see vet there wa someone who vented dog about the fact that their submission got locked right off the bat over that sub think wa someone with aussie that had some rare diagnosis who wasn looking for some cure from some internet rando but just discussion the condition general since their dog already treatment didn happen which shame because would love see some more discussion about actual medicine disease nutrition science from vet perspective instead you mostly get bunch dog ate thing what with the standard see vet response like reading about medicine especially interesting disease wa let down speaking for myself most vet don have the time about medicine with appointment guess stick finding cool research article ,0

don have experience with dog with kidney failure but have dog with serious liver issue and much the time you just live life you would before the illness and diagnosis but you are still reminded every day the condition when you are giving the medicine supplement and prescription dog food well when you are making sure that the dog doesn get into eat thing that aren good for that condition for example liver and kidney issue require low protein diet have another dog who can give bully stick but dog2 shouldn get bully stick have plan around how can give dog1 treat without dog2 stealing bedroom with door closed the solution solution also mean more dehydrated duck head ton scratchy duck crumb bed not good also have watch that dog1 doesn eat dog2 food with medicine the other dog bowl always look more appealing and there the worrying about every sniffle other sign about possible illness the dog this due the condition also monitoring your dog for dog that just being dog she beginning suffer cognitive deterioration from her liver you also will likely spend some time thinking about his life for the next year and how you will insure ha good death when time come for dog2 would like outside the vet office preferably home outside sunny day with dog1 having chance say good bye afterwards but most the time you will you much would like say that treasure every minute with dog2 because know her time limited still treat her like dog and get frustrated with her alert barking just like get frustrated with dog1 dog2 doesn get all the pet just because she ill she still ha share attention with dog1 thing that were big before will also get put into better perspective with dog1 first dog every slightly soft poo had worried and made more vet visit than were warranted soft poos don really bother now better able discern what sign illness and what just mean someone ate too much something last night also decide not worry about thing until have dog2 just had monitoring blood test yesterday vet called today and said well the elevated liver enzyme level really used that dog2 also ha lower than normal kidney level guess little like scarlet hara and will worry about that another day finally make sure you have vet that you really like listens you and very knowledgeable competent with chronic illness good vet care make all the difference for your dog quality life and your peace mind ime dog1 go different vet than dog2 now dog1 develops any issue will also shift her over but for now dog1 with the cheaper inexpensive routine maintenance vet ,0

typically when you bring argument saying thing like respect your family decision and love your dog but the but tends negate everything you mentioned prior while don think unreasonable for you have concern about hashing out general idea what would like own dog together you have recognize that absolutely nothing set stone much like human dog are living creature they have feeling and individual variance the disciplined dog that lie quietly the corner until you deem worth your time interact with that more fantasy something you attain through year training and that continuous work there one size fit all approach owning them and seems that this may more communication problem than specifically dog related issue sound though you perhaps have very rigid approach what you find acceptable not just regard animal and could very well that you communicate that harshly and maybe don compromise well you seem potentially controlling obviously not know you this simply going off your post and response thing you might want keep mind when reflecting though how her family keep their dog their business think some what you describing ideal certainly not however you say yourself you never raised pet and think you have some preconceived notion about how easy may deal with animal don really know pet the right option for you honest ,0

you have careful when giving dog thc human and dog have different endocannabinoid system not vet but understanding that dog have high concentration cb1 receptor their cerebellum the cerebellum primarily responsible for motor control and balance thus when given thc dog lose motor control and balance some people say that dog shouldn given any thc only thc free distillate cbd isolate other people claim that thc safe small dos since thc potentially dangerous may make sense only give dog cbd isolate however commonly said that thc contributes the entourage effect which make other cannabinoids like cbd more effective you decide with full spectrum cbd oil make sure that you not get oil that ha high thc content purchasing from dispensary you could accidentally end with cbd oil that ha high thc content recommendation get cbd isolate oil that ha cbd thc le full spectrum cbd oil treat that are available online are required contain le than thc weight and therefore should safe just reminder not vet recommend talking with your veterinarian before giving your dog and cannabinoid product ,0

yeah that’ probably not enough exercise especially for year old lab the only time she get out for quick “around the block” walk couple time day that could definitely contributing the issue typically dog being destructive ’ because more the following boredom lack exercise anxiety lack rule structure training don’ know enough about your situation make definitive statement one way the other but from what you just told would definitely say lack exercising living boring life probably big contributing factor ,0
would discourage jumping perhaps redirect him sit down prior picking him avoid the leaping ,0
wait wa that thread updated ,0
got her last wednesday ’ still learning about her when ’ home she completely fine when sleep night she never ha any issue she ha only had two “ accidents” the house since got her but they were think the first and second third day when rescued her from the shelter she wa underweight and very dehydrated she drank much water the first few day won’ blame her completely those accident she ha gotten better with her drinking now and she making huge progress with her weight anyway since she still too new and don’ trust her apartment roaming around yet keep her kennel she not big fan going but she will have deal with every time come home she ha peed the crate weather ’ been hour seven can’ keep anything soft there because she just pee and don’ have washer and dryer apartment washing them not easy for also got email from property manager saying that someone complained about barking think she mess with the crate because see small scratch ’ working feeding her the crate but plastic toy the crate and pee pad the crate far all this very frustrating work with because ’ not there for most the day ,0

disagree the toddler and puppy should interacting together but gentle way month old son and week old large breed puppy play together often ha taken two week misdirection for both them time and much reprimanding not corporal and rewarding but they are both learning how together they play version human dog tag where one chase the other and then they switch mind you there still nipping and clothes pulling involved every now and then but isn nearly active wa the beginning and general the puppy ha learned stop when ha the urge prior latching the clothing they will sit together and play with their own toy they will their own way for nap time and general they get along quite well the puppy walk into toddler room greet him the morning and they both get extremely excited begin the day positive interaction must and direct interaction the only way help breed confidence both your child and your dog ,0
that lot work all once and top that having into work too someone else suggested exercise pen would that work with some pee pad think always good idea have dog crate trained maybe she just scared the crate and separation really hope you can find some good solution this and work together alter her behavior ,0
you leave any sort toy long lasting treat with him separation anxiety good guess but might also boredom cattle dog are little braniacs frozen kongs are the classic and there are more recipe than you could possibly try available the internet you could also try investing inexpensive wifi camera have the wyze which will let you see what doing and would even let you talk him though sometimes hearing but not seeing you can stress dog out more you cover the crate when were first crate training rhu hated being left hers until started totally covering with blanket think being able see space but not access can stressful ,0
just make sure that the puppy and the toddler learn and abide the word and good boy girl perhaps getting clicker and associating the click with each positive moment for quite some time would help reinforce positive action the dog just don inadvertently condition your child with the clicker lest you walking them school for their first day with animal cracker and clicker ,0

seen many people get the blame dog attack pit bull not the biggest reason why people defend them extremely they been heavily stigmatized over the last year ban restriction etc and that essentially where the phrase the owner not the breed came from and still hear whenever dog doe attack someone this day pit bull bull terrier and like all pit fighting breed are going have natural dog aggression way your dog fault for being attacked ,0

question one dog highly active this the average there difference between dog that can highly active and dog that need highly active your dog sound like the former german shepherd especially adolescent are usually happy long you out there with them but the fact that your dog wa able acclimate just fine when his activity wa limited for two week say that not overly needy exercise question two overdoing that depends your dog leash off leash for these activity are you trying match his pace trying match yours what kind surface getting his exercise grass concrete etc the only thing you mentioned that immediately made wary wa the fetch fetch can very hard dog body because the repetitive movement and sudden start stop think about cutting back fetch bit general not the amount exercise puppy get that the problem the type exercise puppy that off leash long line natural soft surface and allowed his own pace much le risk for physical issue than puppy that going for run with you the sidewalk road ,0

this sound more like insecurity and fear rather than protection instinct could combination genetic temperament and socialization which can managed they get older but you likely never have two happy confident loving dog where outsider are concerned obedience great way curb fear based aggression because give the dog some kind security and help build trust that you keep them safe because you set and enforce boundary with them their eye you set and enforce boundary with everybody odds are lucy trust your more which why she le secure around stranger when just you working obedience your free time and enforcing boundary will build foundation structure and trust not dominance alpha thing but the principle still generally good leader you can still snuggly and goofy and you don even need have expectation all the time like make fun every day have kong time and make dog give each their paw sit down touch hand stand etc before they get almost think they disappointed they got their kongs for free now lol they also have sit before getting their meal going and out door routine meaningless but give them security the long run they are creature habit and thrive knowing what expect getting your dog focus you and expect reward whenever they see the scary thing anothet good way build confidence even they are reacting negatively rewarding them for seeing the scary thing eventually teach them react looking you instead barking lunging you can always carry couple variety treat give the lesser one they react negatively the scary thing give the better one they see and don react your best make seeing people and dog positive thing even your home you have regular passersby overall mentioned they may never super sociable dog which fine long they aren threat others gaining their trust and teaching them that strange dog and people turn you into treat dispenser are two way prevent issue down the road ,0

the reason you hear all those difference the risk vary greatly from area area this something best discussed with your veterinarian the risk parvo and distemper where you live and the number case they typically see year some place are super low risk and you just need keep them away from high dog traffic area other place are high risk and you can let them touch the ground outside your own residence until they finish all the round shot the rule thumb you don know the area risk not let them touch the ground public surface until lest their second set vaccination the earliest keep them away from dog with unknown health vaccination history and stick just dog that you know the history ,0
like the idea the night bark often browse the off hour this something move forward with ,0
there’ still some risk but the benefit can offset those long the other dog are fully vaxed and preferably the meeting isn’ grass location that other dog unknown vax status might frequent the risk are quite low make sure any pee pooh cleaned immediately and the pup doesn’ come into contact with ,0

you more likely find healthier dog that doesn follow the breed standard but rather focus health work etc why not both there are lot breed club the smaller le controversial one that reward versatility and titling both end related even the show dog world there are people who will put more moderate dog compared the one you see the big all breed show large national regional specialty that invite judge who are intimately familiar with the breed participate can often skew towards not just the pretty dog there are lot judge who reward and value moderation out there and will put dog for breed that excel that they might crushed the group ring and may never the blue carpet national dog show westminster but they can finish championship and grand championship easily under limited showing and earn title the other end ,0

been through this many time with rotating house full senior rescue offer final home with hospice like care sound like your pup slowly declining she will eat when her body let her she may not pain especially you are able keep her fluid that really keep them comfortable but the truth she dying some dog will eat and off until their final natural day the person who love her most hard for you and that truly the best situation for her she trust you help her live when she need and also let her when her life get too hard have had senior who died naturally and dog who died through euthanasia when wa intervention help them not suffer you can save her any suffering moving forward with euthanasia but you feel she ha some life left that she can have comfort for you decide dog that are having some vital organ shut down suffer different way and different level you knowing her best will able tell she suffering one thing can tell you that during natural death when their central nervous system begin shut down that good time intervene with euthanasia this doesn always happen but you notice take heed they and out what seems dreamlike state they start yip and seemingly struggle half awake half asleep type demeanor they sometimes loose total control their bowel and bladder sometimes they seem pain this when want the vet the vet house that personal line most the time unless they are experiencing other outward sign discomfort hope this help bless you for helping your dog finish walking this path knowing she loved and cared for that what they deserve return for the lifetime love and loyalty they provide ,0

but cannot see the border collie likely marker for the color pattern specifically the white which also likely triggering the boston terrier the same reason why black and white purebred papered line bred dog will show have border collie ,0
start feed the dog the crate this will create sense calm about the crate had similar problem with our new puppy talked the vet about worked like champ good luck ,0
huge skeptic when come dog dna test read far too many paper and article debunking their accuracy always chalk result like that marker that are common among certain trait resulting what boil down educated guess but that not popular opinion when presented people who drop lot money these test ,0

personally have clue but someone who currently emailing and speaking one their staff geneticist about some pretty depth genetic testing stuff for breed knowing few friend have done similar stuff help improve their test make discovery about dog genetics expression they are pretty legit and the real deal ,0
definitely wouldn’ take the dog unless you have the money care for but sound like you really love this dog money isn’ problem then maybe you could try out for night two week depending how go see ’ too much you kinda enjoy have two pup also boyfriend but still and love them both dearly would love each pup seperately course didn’ have both the same time but they honestly make each other’ personality they’ always happy see each other and love sleeping together while they are nightmare sometimes ’ glad have both them you have any friend who could adopt the pup don’ end doing ,0
check out your local daycare pet shop and training facility and see they offer weekend play groups—quite few area found them really good option for dog because the group are usually capped small number dog they super cheap and least around here whichever place hosting usually ha staff member there keep thing under control ,0
mom almost four month old can say definitely not get another dog right now would better sense have your dog daycare few time month dog park occasionally another dog even well behaved one will require lot time and energy get used your home ,0
foster the pup see how go while you help find him good home one where people are capable loving experienced responsible pet owner you may surprised very good way how the two dog could bond and bring such joy your home ,0
your dog old will not live forever don try and make ,0
take the pup and work rehoming them yourself putting the dog back into shelter environment isn good for their development this time especially not for high energy dog ,0
okay that you others might not want papillon but papillon fucking whatever mix cool with them just because you don want something doesn mean someone else doesn want either ,0
agree with most your comment ’ weird that wa notified the hearing call from the officer however all know what ha stated their post don’ know being criminally charged and what the charge are the other owner bringing civil suit still the process making the decision whether not take action what ’ decision process normally like etc either way should not represent himself using male pronoun for the sake grammar sorry female this matter charged with criminal offense will appointed counsel but that probably won’ happen until his first court date ’ not familiar with law but someone who represents himself generally won’ get the best outcome because his lack knowledge the legal system and the fact that hard contain your emotion ’ like doctor operating family member know were ’ situation would seeing red and unable think objectively think cannot stress how important for you get lawyer asap you could screw yourself talking the victim the third party the third party just being crazy your lawyer will able deal with you are being charged with criminal offense the victim bringing civil suit the sooner you get lawyer the better your chance having favorable outcome ,0
dog more than twice the work not top that getting dog for your other dog never good idea ,0
pointer not easy dog have similar with the griffon they are high energy breed that need run and with their hunting instinct they are harder train good recall most people that have them around here put gps collar them because they can’ fully trusted read bit the breed but might not ideal first dog you are not planning being particularly active dog park won’ enough they need off leash running and they can run long and hard would check out schnauzer they are lovely companion well spaniel boston terrier maybe ,0
only concern would ingested fiber that then caused intestinal blockage long you remove really worn blanket you should both dog are lickers they love give and hubby bath sometimes the one make cute little grunt noise like sooo happy they both seem enjoy and then cuddle after few minute almost cat like weird ,0
when have owner fill out euthanasia form they have sign that the animal hasn’ bitten anyone day ,0
give try ,0
yeah closed from dusk until dawn regardless the actual time day you might get stopped either local officer park and recreation officer you are there the dark depending how strict your area you become repeat offender you might get ticket ‍♀️ just best guess without actually knowing where you live anything ,0
been giving them dog for year never noticed them being any kind short term zoomie fuel ,0
they are very different breed wouldn consider getting husky for someone who like lab and would like something similar golden retriever would good option for lab fan ,0
clearly not allowed the sign couldn more clear having said that anyway assuming your dog isn vocal walk because there little chance council ranger whoever give the fine for these thing your area being patrol before dawn after dusk just pick after yourself and one will know you are there there always the chance one those people with too much time your hand reporting you but even then the chance getting fined are minimal ,0
myth ,0
true wish someone had told this several decade ago ,0
fyi these measurement don’ really matter that much for larger dog like yours which have you flown him before that’ definitely pushing size wise the sturdibags are really the best choice the top flex fit under any underseat space did write the topic last year for folk who want more info that can found here ,0
had slightly underweight akita and slightly overweight akita not the same time and not because each other the lighter one wa never powerful his prime but lived about year longer and his old age wa better quality had fewer joint issue and think the slow but farther walk kept him going longer lived which isn bad for akita from pound who had bad start life got him adult the slightly overweight one ended needing arthritis med which contributed the seizure that killed him had been bit lighter and able manage with just fish oil like the skinny boy think might have lived longer would err the side little bit thin especially since many dog are fat thin dog isn necessarily that thin ton people use little bit plump mean fat tick ,0
think you’ probably right seemed mean stop him but definitely don’ want him get sore ,0
maybe photo shoot the dog gave sister portrait her dog which she loved ,0
you can take him doggy daycare during the day other than that you want address the problem better you start asap look malena demartini she the expert dog you can also seek out behaviourist who will able help you make training plan help him though this ,0
there anyone helping you hold her know ’ not easy especially when doggo know what’ coming but sometimes good holder fix most the issue have have someone hold dog and cat whenever have put anything them lol other than that can’ think anything besides rewarding her after done not sure she’ make the connection just happy that she’ getting treat pat more iodine her ear hope this help and good luck ,0
about definitely not cheap unfortunately ,0
the measurement absolutely matter the soft carrier larger than the room under the seat most airplane then you want ensure your dog will comfortable when compressed into that area yes have the extra large sturdibag ,0
personally think ’ better “good day” she had some yummy chicken finger and had the day off with her favorite people around telling her how great she why wait until she sick she can’ stand sick she’ starving sick she barely acknowledges you’ there unfortunately especially kidney damage not reversible you can maybe manage sometimes responds but she will always have kidney disease that any time can get much worse think ’ better week too soon than day too late give her the good day and don’ let her get the point that ’ all pain and bad ,0
family recently had put down our sweet old man suffered from cushing and then recently started struggling with diabetes wanted able give him the medication need let him love eating chicken forever but much like your dog the day were more bad than good planned have him put down but then bad weather hit and couldn let him die and not buried perked over those rainy day but then got way worse again truly like perked have final happy goodbye with seems like your dog for more bad day and also seems like they are communicating that their quality life will never what wa and btw happy year more than many dog get ,0
this sentence just triggered the tear all the tear ,0
and echo the other two commenters you are also the exact reason don dog park people who know their dog will attack others under certain circumstance should not ever put their dog situation where that could happen you are irresponsible owner and kind shitty human because you knowingly risk the safety other people dog shame you ,0
some white rice and boiled chicken usually good for weak stomach but should also contact the vet who performed the surgery persists all ,0
dog park don let him walk around your vet lobby pet store basically anywhere that isn 100 controlled environment you should stay far away fostered own through local rescue the woman took him neutered week realized after the fact this rescue resembles more business than non profit and let him and the other puppy that were brought spayed neutered that day run around the lobby together passed from parvo week later you want socialize him make sure place you know you can trust and the other dog there are all date with their vaccination ,0
you have any reason wanting husky beyond how pretty they look they aren’ obedient are high prey drive high energy escape artist that are vocal and shed ton this mostly the opposite the easy going mediumish energy obedient not much barker trustworthy labrador ,0
have done both test wisdom panel said dog wa dash few breed but mostly unidentified mutt couldn’ believe payed learn that haha embark wa able give her breed down small percentage with only being super mutt tbh the breed embark identified made way more sense too ,0
given the size your carrier usually the largest sized sturdibag that’ accepted board and your dog’ weight probably good note that both delta and united carrier inspection the desk something take into account you’ trying get dog and carrier that large onto aircraft have dog that’ under pound typically the top weight limit for taking dog onboard dog over inch the shoulder are also going struggle and personally have never had issue with her fitting under any plane seat ’ flown delta united southwest frontier and jetblue ,0
had this same problem with our pitweiler she wa incredibly destructive she somehow managed snap the plastic bottom the kennel into bunch piece and bend the kennel several place she stopped escaping from her kennel once started placing large object front think wa night stand first assumption wa that she thought her way out wa blocked she stopped trying escape can expensive having destructive dog with separation anxiety she’ destroyed lot our personal property well carpet place ’ rented she chewed the cord our computer cord for the and ate several jar fish food wish could trust her not crate but least know she isn’ hurting herself when aren’ home hope you’ able find something that work for you ,0
month show other sporting event meet people talk people get opinion get know breeder want relationship with breeder there way hell gsd without all chic test doesn have ofa pennhip fine really important want compete with dog and the achievement their parent give valuable insight into what dog likely excel that being said only interested working line shepherd and such fine with non titled but working parent police sar etc kind depends honest 000 would guesstimate but that variable actually puppy raise dutch belgian shepherd for breeder before they off their respective agency training start day one and invest most time into setting schedule socialization not play time but engagement rewarding curiosity positive exposure engagement training and then introducing concept such shaping and luring don really care about obedience much because the reality you lay the foundation how the dog should learn the actual teaching part easy carry treat and capture behavior much possible enforced nap time because working line dog think that the off switch what happens when you collapse from exhaustion ,0
puppy proof the room leave food and bit water puppy pad toy and maybe radio leave for few minute come back keep extending the time and see how she behaves leave kennel open with her bed and maybe try peanut butter and kong ball perhaps she would happier not being confined and would le destructive never kennel trained pup just house trained use kong treat ball pup pad puppy proofing something with scent and smallish room never had any issue ,0
had patient mine one absolute favorite they told got peanut butter shake before coming how great took cake with when put dog sleep she ate bit and then had the rest for and one for the staff too because they did much for her and well they deserved cake too ,0
the parent absolutely 100 must health tested for the common problem with the breed first because wise thing know for your individual puppy but also more importantly because responsible breeder would even consider skipping this step breeding dog without appropriate rating they aren’ doing this who know what other corner they are cutting what kind dog you’ get this non negotiable you are not buying from responsible breeder they are not doing these test period the breeder should have problem sending you the test result paperwork for each the parent ,0
honestly these sign exist mostly curb illegal activity honestly like others have said just long your dog isn going make scene officer see you they likely just shoo you away anyway which case then you can decide whether push your luck not experience wa hanging out park parking lot car with friend just chatting after hour had the same law sign but didn even notice them officer saw car and came and knocked the window open the window and asked what were said were just hanging out asked were doing drug weren and then just told leave because the park wa closed harm foul sure you even bothered officer once they discern you not doing anything nefarious you fine ,0
what about human turtleneck sweater depending the dog kid size adult the arm you could cut off some the sleeve and some the body would keep the whole thing from shifting down ,0
wa lucky and both gsds kind fell lap wouldn’ hesitate spend month two researching breeder and then spend month waiting list for the next litter personally wouldn’ spend much over month just waiting but plenty people all the importance seriously this breed magnificent but riddled with health issue hip and elbow submitted ofa unaffected and recent eye exam absolute minimum 110 non negotiable exception super important for but objectively le important the grand scheme thing like health testing compete and work dog having parent that also competed and worked the same venue mine will very important for pet would want see some sort obedience rally cgc temperament test show that they are mentally stable this going vary greatly line wouldn’ expect spend over 1500 for working line dog but show line easily start 2000 2500 and just keep going ’ not interested those line wouldn’ pay that much but ’ not actually that unreasonable compared similar line breeder and it honestly drop the bucket year from now carry treat constantly and just reward everything you like shoveled dog full kibble for just being quiet normal animal not barking out the window handful kibble not actively chewing have bully stick also use lot food dispensing toy like kong’ and chew like nylabones antler etc also crate wonderful invention hope that help feel free reach out with any more question ,0
read bit your answer the post yea really doesn’ sound like anything mean just attempt play just for future day care ours ha pool room play room lot grassy area where they get walked usually our dog get play with others have pool time and get walked even get little report who she played with and poop and pee they also birthday party and send other dog home with goodie and holiday event santa pic valentine’ day card and all that all the dog are always supervised and they keep one that get along group the one that don’ like other dog are kept separate but they still get walk and pic and fun met doggie there who’ not part the group fun but still come all the time and the owner seemed really happy with the service ,0
that awesome those are the people you wanna deal with absolutely good luck ,0
let her peace she ate but she declining give her kiss love her tell her you are proud her then let her cry remember and have her memory your heart forever that love don delay what you know deep down best ,0
following the breeder you mentioned not fan really they have fuck ton litter ground you cannot convince that they are able become intimately familiar with each those puppy and effectively pair them with their future owner ’ just too many dog also look like they just import titled male and breed them untitled female thanks they’ not even trying breed together complimentary dog they’ just throwing stuff together and hoping stick check out gsdca’ breeder referral list their website ,0

wa also under the impression that somewhat irresponsible have intact male onsite with the breeding female too easy for accidental pairing litter ,0
fair enough suppose depending where you live area anyone who meet all the other criterion listed who charge the realm 2500 would the only person nearby with that quality dog and would control freak about their line friend who are reputable breeder own both parent because they are also behaviorist unfortunately see lot 100 gsd pup sigh but digress you live elsewhere your mileage could vary ,0
cat last meal wa ham when wa sick his favorite food which hadn had the opportunity have long feel your pain completely the selfless thing let your pup enjoy their last meal and let them could get even worse far before get remotely better again ,0
that’ not irresponsible all accidental litter are easy prevent ’ totally fine for breeder have intact male that they offer stud and intact female that they breed but ’ unlikely that the male and female the breeder ha produced will great match much more likely for their complimentary match somewhere else the world just statistically speaking ,0
kidney disease doe not get better only get worse and can quite painful sound like ’ time imo ,0

first time seeing fakespot but you’ comparing embark’ breed health test wisdom panel’ breed test— when you look the fakespot score for the get with only few review also checked reviewmeta get better idea why the site think embark’ review are fake and based just that think the rating unfair the unverified purchase can explained embark having lot sale through their website people receiving gift there only review they flagged being incentivized out 590 and gave the product the “reviewer ease” score just mean people who reviewed the product rate stuff point higher than people who didn’ which though say that’ unnatural ’ willing overlook the only one that stand out “reviewed participation”— most reviewer have posted le than total review amazon— but even that can overlook the product overwhelmingly impressive people are more likely rate think people also just like sharing their result plan write review once get dog’ back even though rarely write review what make think that embark’ review are genuine are the word count comparison and phrase repetition score fake review tend short and repetitive and embark’ are anything but the only thing that tripped the review sites’ detector were that the review were overwhelmingly positive and from unverified purchaser which both could just mean that people liked the product and were excited share their result regardless where they purchased actually barely looked amazon when deciding between embark and wisdom panel there are bunch article out there comparing the two and nearly all them say embark seems more accurate give more detail ha better user interface and ha better customer service ,0
been bathed since started assumed wa trying remove some gunk however there wa gunk there this evening before started doing now that ha however the hair sticky and knotted you think trying groom himself ,0
being the only quality breeder your area the biggest reason for using stud outside your area your population pretty limiting otherwise ,0
lab also blow their coat though admittedly not the same extent came into the groomers last time mine went for bath and there wa startling amount off white fluff floating about like someone the set western over ordered the tumbleweed but you’ right they’ very different dog most lab can manage with lower exercise than most husky can and are happier thing for you because you asked rather than because they’ decided ’ what they want ,0
not dog but neighbor’ dog lived until she had put him down few day after his birthday this dog wa walked for mile every day well shorter period outside every day wa total heinz might have had some beagle him neighbor rescued him week old puppy and doted him she fed him the best food she could afford gave him massage his later year once year vet visit with thorough health check his last year had several stroke but his owner helped him walk until got stronger again after one the stroke wa very confused for while could not remember many word had known all his life friend with infinite patience taught him the word all over again whether his dna had something with the longevity wa his owner’ dedication idk ,0

yes they blow coat every double coated dog doe lab just shed alot more consistently throughout the year and husky have huge extreme coat blowing season whereas the lab coat blow not nearly likely give you extra dog ,0
there’ niche etsy for this take look what people are selling how much they charge which those have lot favorite and what seller with high rating are doing ’ bought couple collar off etsy and they’ fantastic better quality that what you’ get store for the same price they’ jacquard ribbon stitched onto nylon webbing seller are often willing make custom size and some will let you select color pattern combo wanted unique stylish design with good quality material metal hardware fabric that won’ fade pick dirt easily etc and good quality stitching for collar that will hold for long time ,0

yeah for heavy breeder sure most the people area who can command that kind money for puppy don breed very often maybe litter every couple year and meticulously planned amongst themselves and their friend don know any good gsd breeder and the only great breeder know focus service dog with another really conscientious breeder who breed hunting dog for heavier breeder sure would logistical issue and sure there are good heavy breeder out there somewhere though man have say have never examined more sound better behaved puppy than those service dog pup satisfying all ,0
okay first off penis size doesn usually change with the amount time they are left intact usually what only the size his scrotum that can more pronounced wa neutered later life anyways your spayed girl still come into season because remaining tissue then basically all the concern her being intact still exist except for her ability impregnated she still smell good still want breed her she can still get pyometra and she still getting the level hormone that vet all scream about when they say leaving bitch intact increase her chance mammary tumor not eating because she season and driving him crazy yes will still try breed her and yes they can still tie puppy will not result but they can hurt each other left unsupervised would really recommend acting she still ha all her uterus and keep them apart both for his sanity and both their safety x200b ,0
